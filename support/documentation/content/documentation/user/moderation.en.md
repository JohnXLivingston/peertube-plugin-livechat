You can access room settings and moderation tools by opening the chat in a new window,
and using the dropdown menu at the top right.

You can list all existing chatrooms: in the plugin settings screen, there is a button «List rooms».

You can delete old rooms: join the room, and use the menu on the top to destroy the room.

## Notes

All instance moderators and admins will be owner of created chat rooms.
If the video is local (not from a remote Peertube), the video owner will be admin in the chat room.

You can use [ConverseJS moderation commands](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/features.html#moderating-chatrooms) to moderate the room.
When you open the chat room in full screen, there will also be a menu with dedicated commands on the top right.
