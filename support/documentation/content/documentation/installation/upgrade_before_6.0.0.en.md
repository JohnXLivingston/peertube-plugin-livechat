## IMPORTANT NOTE

Since version v6.0.0, this plugin does not need any Prosody installation.

If you were using this plugin before this version, and if you had installed Prosody manually, you can safely uninstall Prosody.

If you were using the custom Peertube docker image that is embedding Prosody, you can switch back to the official Peertube image.
