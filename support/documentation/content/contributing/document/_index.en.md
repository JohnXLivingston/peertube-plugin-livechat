## General information

Always inform the community before working (by creating a new issue, or commenting an existing one). This is to avoid that two persons are
working on the same thing, and prevent conflicts.

Please use the `develop` branch. The `main` branch is reserved to released versions of the plugin, so that the documentation is always synchronized with the released version of the plugin.

The documentation source code is in the `support/documentation/content` folder.

The documentation is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
You have to install it on your computer if you want to preview your work.

The used theme is [hugo-theme-learn](https://learn.netlify.app/).
You should read its documentation before starting editing the documentation.

## Translations

The principal language is english (`en` code).

The different translations of the same file are side by side in the
tree, and are identified by a language code in the file name extension.
Example: `_index.fr.md` is the French translation of `_index.en.md`.

Please note that a missing translation file will not appear in the menus of the generated site.

**Always make sure to create files for all languages**, even if the translation is not yet available.

For this, there is a script `doc-generate-missing-translations.sh` in the root of the repository. When you add a new file, you just have to create the english version, then run this script. It will create all  missing translations, putting a sample message inviting the user to read the english version.

## Add a new language

In the `support/documentation/config.toml` file, please copy and modify the `[Languages.fr]` section.

Then, run the `doc-generate-missing-translations.sh` script.
It will create all the missing files.

Then you can translate them one by one.
If the translations are not complete, it does not matter, the generated files will display a message suggesting to change the language.
