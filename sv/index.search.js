var relearn_search_index=[{breadcrumb:"Peertube livechat",content:`What is the livechat plugin? This Peertube plugin is meant to provide a chat system for Peertube videos.
By default, once you have installed the plugin on your Peertube instance, a chat room will automatically be created for each live stream.
On the following screenshot, you can see a classic Peertube video page, with a chat room on the right (click on the picture to view it full screen):
The chat room will be accessible for all viewers, even those who don’t have an account on your instance. Those “anonymous” users just have to choose a nickname before they can begin talking in the chat.
By default, the chat is displayed next to the video. But you can open it in another browser tab, using the button on top of it :
Tip You can test the livechat plugin with this demo page.
Installation As a Peertube administrator, you can setup this plugin on your instance simply by using the Peertube plugin marketplace included in the administration interface. Search for “livechat”, then click “install”: that’s it!
Livechat capabilities The plugin has many advanced features. As it is using the XMPP standard “under the hood”, it is possible for Peertube administrators to allow advanced usages (connection using XMPP clients, chatbots, bridge to other chat protocols, …). More information in the relevant sections of this documentation.
Federation Peertube is part of the fediverse: you can create a network of Peertube instances, sharing content between them.
This plugin can handle federation: when viewing a livestream from a remote instance, you will join the chat room with your local account. You will be automatically connected with your current nickname and avatar.
Of course, for the federation to work, the plugin must be installed on both instances.
Moderation Some times, you have to protect your community from bad people. As an instance administrator, you can choose to disallow federation for the livechat plugin. If remote actors behave badly, streamers, moderators and administrators can ban or mute users.
Chat bot This plugin comes with a built-in chat bot. Check its documentation for more information.
You can also plug in any other XMPP chat bot, using XMPP External Components. To do so, you just have to configure External Components access in the plugin settings.
Chat persistence When joining a room, you will see previous messages. Even those sent before you joined the room.
This behaviour can be changed room by room, and default retention duration can be chosen by instance’s administrators.
Integrate the chat in your live stream When using software as OBS for you live stream, you can embed the chat in the video stream. This is for example useful for replays.
In the following screenshot, you can see a live replay, where the chat content is embeded on bottom of the video:
In the following screenshot, you can see an OBS setup, where the chat is included as a source in the current scene (background color can be changed, and can be transparent):
Other usages By default, each streamer will be able to activate/deactivate the chat for their live streams.
But on the instance level, administrators can choose to activate the chat for all videos (live and/or VOD).
You can even activate the chat for specific VOD videos. This is how the demo page works: it is not a live stream, but I have activated the chat specifically for this video.`,description:"Introduction",tags:[],title:"Introduction",uri:"/peertube-plugin-livechat/sv/intro/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Peertube livechat > Contributing",content:` Tip This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.

There are two slightly different use cases, depending on wether or not you have an account on the Peertube instance. See bellow for more informations.
If you haven’t a Peertube account Warning This feature can be disabled by the instance’s adminitrators.
If you are not logged in on the Peertube instance where you are watching the video, you will automatically join the chat. You will be assigned a random nickname (something like “Anonymous 12345”).
Before being able to speak in the chat room, you have to enter a nickname in the field on the bottom of the window.
Log in using an external authentication provider Warning This feature can be disabled by the instance’s adminitrators.
The Peertube instance can configure external authentication providers (Mastodon accounts, Google accounts, …). In such case, you will see a “Log in using an external account” button, that will open a dialog modal. In this dialog modal, there will be some buttons to connect using a remote account.
Once you signed in the remote account, and have granted access, your nickname and avatar (if available) will be automatically fetched. No other data will be stored. These data will be automatically deleted several hours after your quit the chat.
If you have a Peertube account If you are connected with your Peertube account, you will automatically join the room, using your Peertube nickname and avatar.
Tip If you are watching a live on an instance on which you have no account, but you have an account on another instance: if the livechat plugin is installed on both instances, it is possible to join the chat using your account. To do so, just open the video on your instance (you can for example copy/paste the video url in the search field of your instance).
If you have a Peertube account on another Peertube instance Info This feature comes with the livechat plugin version 9.0.0. If you have a Peertube account, but not on the current instance, there is a “Log in using an external account” button. This button will open a dialog where you can enter your Peertube instance URL. Once you entered it, it will check if the livechat plugin is available on the remote instance, and if the video is available. If it is the case, you will be redirected to the video on the remote instance.
Chatting To send messages, just type them in the “message” field on the bottom of the screen. You can send them by pressing the enter key on your keyboard, or by clicking on the “send” button.
If you want to add line breaks in your messages, you can use the “shift+enter” key combination.
You can add emojis to your messages. You can for example use the emojis menu, or directly type emojis shortcuts like :smiley:.
You can mention other participants. To do so, you can type the first nickname letters, then press the tab key. You can also type @: this will directly open the menu. You can also click on a nickname in the participants list to insert it in the message field.
Participants list To see the list of participants, just open the right menu:
You can see that some participants have special rights (moderator, owner, …).
Chat dropdown menu There is a dropdown menu on the top of the chat, with some advanced features. This is especially useful for moderation features. Available features depends on your access level.
Opening full screen On top of the chat, there is a button to open the chat in fullscreen. This will open a new browser tab with the following content:
It can be easier to chat using a full browser tab.
Changing nickname You can change your nickname by typing /nick your_new_nickname in the message field.
You can also change your nickname using the chat menu.`,description:"How to chat for stream viewers",tags:[],title:"For viewers",uri:"/peertube-plugin-livechat/sv/documentation/user/viewers/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Peertube livechat > Documentation > Admin documentation",content:`This section describes the plugin settings page.
Channel’s chat terms & conditions You can configure a “terms & conditions” message that will be shown to users joining your chatrooms.
For more information on this feature, check the documentation for channel’s terms & conditions.
Info Changing this setting will restart the chat server, and all users will be disconnected for a short time.
Visa redan skapade rum When pressing the «List rooms» button, all existing chatrooms will be listed. You can then find them and moderated them.
Federation Following settings concern the federation with other Peertube instances, and other fediverse softwares.
Don’t display remote chats By checking this setting, your instance will never display chats from remote videos.
Don’t publish chat information By checking this setting, your instance will not publish chat information on the fediverse. Remote Peertube instances will not be aware that they are chat rooms associated to your videos.
Please note: if you already had chats in progress, it is possible that the information has already been published. You will have to wait for the next video update before the information is unpublished. Also, if you disable this setting, you’ll have to wait for the videos to be updated before the information are published again. This update happens among others when a live event resumes or stops.
Please note: this setting only affects the publication of information via the ActivityPub protocol. It will not prevent a remote application from otherwise detecting the presence of chats, and trying to connect to it.
Authentication Disable livechat tokens In case you have any trouble with the long term authentication tokens, you can disable the feature here.
External Authentication See the detailed documentation page:
External Authentication
Channel advanced configuration Following settings concern the advanced channel options: users will be able to add some customization on their channels, activate the moderation bot, …
Disable the advanced channel configuration and the chatbot If you encounter any issue with this feature, you can disable it.
Chat behaviour Typ av rum Här kan du välja om du vill ha separata rum för varje video eller gruppera dem per kanal.
Öppna chatten automatiskt Öppna chattrutan automatiskt när videon spelas upp.
Visa knappen ”öppna i nytt fönster” There will be a button for opening the web chat in a new window.
Show the «share chat link» button This feature enables a «share chat link» modal. With this modal, you can generate URLs to join the chat. The chat can be customized (readonly mode, use the current theme, …).
You can for example generate a readonly URL and use it in OBS to integrate the chat in your live stream!
This setting allows you to choose who can access this modal.
Användare kan aktivera chatten för sina direktsändningar If checked, all live videos will have a checkbox in their properties for enabling the web chat.
The video owner will be able to activate web chats.
Aktivera chatt för alla direktsändningar If checked, the chat will be enabled for all lives.
Activate chat for all non-lives If checked, the chat will be enabled for all video that are not lives.
Aktivera chatten för dessa videor Videos UUIDs for which we want a web chat. Can be non-live videos. One per line. You can add comments: everything after the # character will be stripped off, and empty lines ignored.
Don’t add private videos, the UUIDs will be sent to the frontend.
Dölj chatten för anonyma användare If checked, anonymous Peertube users won’t see the chat. This feature is still experimental. If you enabled it, it is highly recommended to also check “Don’t publish chat information”. Otherwise, some third party tools could try to open the chat, and have unpredictable behaviours.
Note: for now this feature simply hide the chat. In a future release, the chat will be replaced by a message saying «please log in to […]». See v5.7.0 Release Notes for more information.
Ban anonymous user’s IP when user is banned from a chatroom By enabling this option, each time an anonymous user is banned from a chatroom, it’s IP will also be banned from the chat server. Warning: if your instance is open to registration, any user could create a trapped-room, invite users to join, and automatically ban all anonymous user’s IPs. The banned IP list is not stored, it will be cleared on server restart, or when you change some plugin’s settings. The banned IP are logged in the Prosody server log files, so server’s administrators can eventually use some external tools (like fail2ban) to ban IPs more widely.
Important note: If you enable this feature, and are using a custom reverse proxy on front of Peertube, please make sure that your setup is correctly configured to forward real user’s IPs to Peertube. Otherwise it could block all anonymous users at once.
Theming Avatar set You can choose from several different sets the default avatars that will be used for chat users.
Sepia (Peertube mascot): David Revoy’s Peertube avatar generator, CC-By license
Cats: David Revoy’s cat avatar generator, CC-By license
Birds: David Revoy’s bird avatar generator, CC-By license
Fenecs (Mobilizon mascot): David Revoy’s fenec/mobilizon avatar generator, CC-By license
Abstract: David Revoy’s Abstract avatar generator, CC-By license
Legacy Sepia avatars (those included in previous plugin versions): Based on David Revoy' work, AGPL-v3 license
If you can’t see the change immediatly, it could be because of your browser cache. Just clear your browser session storage, or restart it.
ConverseJS-tema You can choose which theme to use for ConverseJS:
Peertube theme: this is a special theme, made especially for peertube’s integration. Default ConverseJS theme: this is the default ConverseJS theme. ConverseJS cyberpunk theme: this is a theme provided by ConverseJS. Automatisk färgigenkänning Try to autodetect colors from user’s current theme.
When this setting is enabled, the plugin tries to auto-detect colors to apply to the chat theme.
If this is not correctly working for some of your Peertube theme, you can disable this option. You can report the bug on the official issue tracker . Don’t forget to specify which theme is not working.
Webchat iframe style attribute Additional styles to be added on the iframe style attribute. Example: height:400px;
Chat server advanced settings Use system Prosody The plugin comes with an AppImage that is used to run the Prosody XMPP server. If this AppImage is not working, you can fallback to the Prosody that is packaged for your server. Just install the prosody package.
This setting should only be used if the plugin is broken, and waiting for a patch.
Disable Websocket With Peertube >= 5.0.0, this plugin try to use Websocket connection for chatting. If the user’s browser or connection is incompatible, the browser will automatically fall back on the BOSH protocol. But in rare case, this can fail. For example, if you have a reverse proxy in front of Peertube that does not allow Websocket connection for plugins. In this case, you can check this setting to disable Websocket connections.
Prosody port The port that will be used by the Prosody server.
Change it if this port is already in use on your server.
You can close this port on your firewall, it will not be accessed from the outer world.
Note: this might change in a near future, as it is planned to add a feature to activate external connections.
Peertube url for API calls Please let this setting empty if you don’t know what you are doing.
In some rare cases, Prosody can’t call Peertube’s API from its public URI. You can use this field to customize Peertube’s URI for Prosody modules (for example, with «http://localhost:9000» or «http://127.0.0.1:9000»).
If this setting is left empty, and you are using Peertube >= 5.1 or later, the plugin will use values from your Peertube configuration file to guess on which interface and port request have to be done.
In last resort, it will use your Peertube public URI. So, any API Call will go throught your Nginx server. This could fail in some case: for example if you are in a Docker container, where the public hostname does not resolve to the correct IP. In such case, try changing the “Peertube url for API calls” settings, by setting http://127.0.0.1:9000 (assuming 9000 is the port on which Peertube listen, ask your instance administrators if you don’t know).
Log rooms content by default If checked, room contents will be saved by default. Any user who joins a room will see what was written before they joins.
Please note that it is always possible to enable/disable the content archiving for a specific room, by editing its properties.
Room logs expiration You can choose here how long the chatting room’s content is kept by the server. The value can be:
60: the content will be saved for 60 seconds. You can replace 60 by any integer value. 1d: the content will be saved for 1 day. You can replace 1 by any integer value. 1w: the content will be saved for 1 week. You can replace 1 by any integer value. 1m: the content will be saved for 1 month. You can replace 1 by any integer value. 1y: the content will be saved for 1 year. You can replace 1 by any integer value. never: the content will never expire, and will be kept forever. Enable connection to room using external XMPP accounts By enabling this option, it will be possible to connect to rooms using external XMPP accounts and XMPP clients.
Warning, enabling this option can request extra server and DNS configuration. Please refer to the documentation: Enable external XMPP account connections. Prosody server to server port The port that will be used for XMPP s2s (server to server) connections.
You should use the standard 5269 port. Otherwise you should setup a specific DNS record .
Server to server network interfaces The network interfaces to listen on for server to server connections.
List of IP to listen on, coma separated (spaces will be stripped).
You can use «*» to listen on all IPv4 interfaces, and «::» for all IPv6.
Examples:
*, :: * 127.0.0.1, ::1 172.18.0.42 Certificates folder If this field is empty, the plugin will generate and use self-signed certificates.
If you want to use other certificates, just specify here the folder where Prosody can find them. Note: the “peertube” user must have read access to this folder.
Enable client to server connections Enable XMPP clients to connect to the built-in Prosody server.
This option alone only allows connections from localhost clients.
This setting enable XMPP clients to connect to the built-in Prosody server. For now, this option only allows connections from localhost clients.
As example, this option can allow an instance of Matterbridge (once it could use anonymous login) on the same machine to bridge your chat with another services like a Matrix room.
Prosody client to server port The port that will be used by the c2s module of the built-in Prosody server.
XMPP clients shall use this port to connect.
Change it if this port is already in use on your server.
You can keep this port closed on your firewall for now, it will not be accessed from the outer world.
Note: this might change in a near future, as it is planned to add a feature to activate external connections.
Client to server network interfaces The network interfaces to listen on for client to server connections.
This setting is provided for advanced users. Don’t change this setting if you don’t fully understand what it means.
List of IP to listen on, coma separated (spaces will be stripped).
You can use «*» to listen on all IPv4 interfaces, and «::» for all IPv6.
Examples:
*, :: * 127.0.0.1, ::1 127.0.0.1, ::1, 172.18.0.42 Enable custom Prosody external components This setting enable XMPP external components to connect to the server. By default, this option only allows connections from localhost components. You have to change the “Prosody external components network interfaces” value to listen on other network interfaces.
This feature could be used to connect bridges or bots.
More informations on Prosody external components here.
Enable custom Prosody external components Enable the use of external XMPP components.
This option alone only allows connections from localhost. You have to setup the listening interfaces and open the port on your firewall to make it available from remote servers.
This feature can, for example, be used to connect some bots to the chatting rooms.
Prosody external components port The port that will be used by XMPP components to connect to the Prosody server.
Change it if this port is already in use on your server.
You can keep this port closed on your firewall if you don’t allow access on interfaces other than localhost.
Prosody external components network interfaces The network interfaces to listen on for external components connections.
List of IP to listen on, coma separated (spaces will be stripped).
You can use «*» to listen on all IPv4 interfaces, and «::» for all IPv6.
Examples:
*, :: * 127.0.0.1, ::1 172.18.0.42 External components The external components to declare:
One per line. Use the format «component_name:component_secret» (spaces will be trimmed). You can add comments: everything after the # character will be stripped off, and empty lines ignored. The name can only contain latin alphanumeric characters and dots. If the name contains only alphanumeric characters, it will be suffixed with the XMPP domain. For example, «bridge» will become «bridge.your_domain.tld». You can also specify a full domain name, but you have to make sure to configure your DNS correctly. Only use alphanumeric characters in the secret passphrase (use at least 15 characters). Enable Prosody mod_firewall You can enable mod_firewall on your Prosody server.

You can enable some external authentication methods to allow user to create chat accounts. In such case their nickname and avatar will be automatically initialized with the remote account information.
Such “external account users” will be easier to moderate than anonymous accounts.
This also allows user to join the chat without creating Peertube account (in case your instance has closed registration for example, or without waiting for account approval).
This page will describe available authentication methods.
For the user documentation, see user documentation
OpenID Connect Warning This feature is still experimental. This feature is available with the plugin version >= 9.0.0.
You can configure one external OpenID Connect compatible provider.
Doing so, you can for example use your website for Single Sign-On.
Popular CMS softwares (Wordpess, …) offers plugins implementing OpenID Connect.
To enable this feature, first you have to create a client on your provider side (check the related documentation for enabling OpenID Connect). Then go to the plugin settings, and enable “Use an OpenID Connect provider”.
Note: if you want to restrict allowed redirection urls on the provider side (best security practice), the plugin will show you the url to allow. Just copy it in your OpenID Connect application configuration.
You will now have to fill some settings.
Label for the connection button This label will be displayed to users, as the button label to authenticate with this OIDC provider.
This is the button label in the following screenshot:
For now, it is not possible to localize this label.
Discovery URL Your OpenID Connect provider must implement the discovery URL. Just set here the discovery url, that should be something like https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration.
Note: if your provider use the standard /.well-known/openid-configuration path, you can omit it. For example https://accounts.google.com will work.
Client ID Your application Client ID.
Client secret You application Client secret.
Google, Facebook, … In addition to that, you can also configure one or several “standard” Open ID Connect provider (Google, Facebook, …).
For these providers, discovery url and button label are preset. You just have to create an OAuth2 application on the provider side, and configure Client ID and Client Secret.
If you think of a standard provider that is not available, you can ask for implementation by opening a new issue.
Troubleshooting If the button does not appear for end users, there might be a configuration issue. You can try the diagnostic tool to get more information.
Note: if you are connected to your Peertube account, the button will never show. So use a private browser window to test.
If the button is displayed but is not working, check your Peertube logs. It could be because the remote service does not use standard scopes or attribute names.
More to come Other authentication methods will be implemented in the future.`,description:"Plugin Peertube Livechat settings - External Authentication",tags:[],title:"External Authentication",uri:"/peertube-plugin-livechat/sv/documentation/admin/external_auth/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Peertube livechat > Documentation > User documentation > For streamers > Chat bot",content:`You can configure some words that will be automatically moderated by the bot (messages containing such words will be instantly deleted). You can also add an optional reason that will be displayed at the place of deleted messages. Several examples are provided on the documentation page.
You can fill several “Förbjudna ord och uttryck” fields. When a user sends a message that match the configured criteria, the message will automatically be deleted.
Förbjudna ord och uttryck In this field, you can set several words, group of words, or “regular expressions”.
One word or expression per line. If you put multiple words on one line, it will only match messages containing the whole sequence.
Each time a user sends a message, these words will be tested. If the message containes one of them, the message will be deleted.
You can for example fill this field with a swear words list.
To get some examples, please check these forbidden words suggestions.
If you have some usefull words lists, you are welcome to contribute to this suggestion page. There are in the support/forbidden_words folder of the livechat source code. See the contribution guide for more information.
Tip These words are case insensitive.
Tip You can combine a short moderation delay (1 second for example) with the moderation bot to delete messages containing swear words before any non-moderator user will see them.
Warning This features is still experimental. There might be some issues with non-latin alphabets. You can open an issue to report your problems.
Consider as regular expressions By checking this option, each line of the “Förbjudna ord och uttryck” field will be considered as a regular expression.

Tip To install or update the plugin, just use the Peertube web admin interface.
Here are some other more specific instructions:
TroubleshootingSome classic mistakes and workarounds.
Known issues: CPU CompatibilityFor now, the plugin only works out of the box for x86_64 and arm64 CPU architecture. Here are some instructions for other CPU architectures.
Upgrade from version older than 6.0.0Important notes when upgrading for an older version.`,description:"Plugin peertube-plugin-livechat installation guide",tags:[],title:"Installation guide",uri:"/peertube-plugin-livechat/sv/documentation/installation/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Peertube livechat > Documentation > Installation guide",content:`The Prosody AppImage included in the plugin will only work on x86_64 and arm64 CPU. It is not compatible with other CPU architectures.
To use the plugin, you will have to manually install Prosody on your server (see below).
Note: the plugin requires Prosody >= 0.12.0. If you are using an older version, Chat Federation could be broken, and it could have some unexpected behaviour.
Once it is done, you have to check Use system Prosody in the plugin settings.
On non-docker Peertube installation For standard installation, you just have to install the official prosody package for your linux distribution.
For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt install prosodyYou can then disable the service that starts automatically when you install Prosody (the plugin will launch a Prosody process, there is no need for the service to run). For example, on Debian/Ubuntu (and other Systemd based linux distributions):
sudo systemctl disable prosody && sudo systemctl stop prosodyWarning: do not disable Prosody if it is used for another service on your server, like for example Jitsi.
Docker You will have to generate a Peertube image that includes Prosody in the same container that Peertube. I know this is not the standard way to do this with Docker, but keep in mind it is a temporary workaround.
To generate and use such an image, please refer to the Docker documentation. The Docker file to generate the image should be:
FROM chocobozzz/peertube:production-bullseye RUN apt -y update && apt install -y prosody && apt -y cleanYunohost You have to disable metronome (the XMPP server provided by Yunohost), and install prosody.
This is already done by the Yunohost Peertube application, as it was required for the plugin before the v6.0.0.
But it may be removed in a near feature (to avoid drawbacks of this method). I have to discuss with Yunohost team, to decide how we can do to minimize drawbacks, and maximize compatibility.`,description:"For now, the plugin only works out of the box for x86_64 and arm64 CPU architecture.

These features are available with the plugin version >= 7.2.0.
Introduction Peertube is part of the Fediverse. So Peertube video can be watched from other Peertube instances, and from various other softwares:
from a Mastodon (or other fediverse application) instance, from a mobile app (Fedilab, Tusky, …), from desktop fediverse app, … This livechat plugin is using well known standards, so it is possible to join chat rooms even when not viewing the video on Peertube.
There are basically 2 ways to join the chat room associated to a video:
opening a web page (with an url like https://yourinstance.tld/plugins/livechat/router/webchat/room/8df24108-6e70-4fc8-b1cc-f2db7fcdd535), using a XMPP client (and joining a room like xmpp://8df24108-6e70-4fc8-b1cc-f2db7fcdd535@room.yourinstance.tld?join) Warning Joining the chat using a XMPP client is not always possible. It requires some DNS and server configuration. It will only be possible if instance’s admins have correctly setup the external XMPP clients connection feature.
Warning Don’t try to gues these url and connection methods yourself. Please report to next chapters.
Chat discovery Using ActivityPub The livechat plugin adds some data in Video ActivityPub objects, so that the chat can be discovered.
Info This requires Peertube >= 5.1
This follows the FEP-1970 recommendations.
Warning At the time of the writing, this FEP is in draft status, and the livechat plugin is a Proof-of-concept. Until the FEP is adopted, the specification can change, and the livechat plugin will be adapted accordingly.
Basically, the chat will be declared as attachments on the Video object, using the discussion relation.
By default, here is an example of what you will get:
{ "@context": [ "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams", "https://w3id.org/security/v1", { "RsaSignature2017": "https://w3id.org/security#RsaSignature2017" }, { // ... } ], "to": [ "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public" ], "cc": [ "https://yourinstance.tld/accounts/root/followers" ], "type": "Video", "id": "https://yourinstance.tld/videos/watch/8df24108-6e70-4fc8-b1cc-f2db7fcdd535", "name": "The video title", // ...

{ "@context": [ "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams", "https://w3id.org/security/v1", { "RsaSignature2017": "https://w3id.org/security#RsaSignature2017" }, { // ... } ], "to": [ "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public" ], "cc": [ "https://yourinstance.tld/accounts/root/followers" ], "type": "Video", "id": "https://yourinstance.tld/videos/watch/8df24108-6e70-4fc8-b1cc-f2db7fcdd535", "name": "The video title", // ...

get the Video ActivityPub object, if there is no attachment key, stop. loop through the attachment values (if attachment is not an array, just iterate on this single value) search for an entry with rel === discussion, and with href using the https scheme (that begins with https://) if found, open this href If you want to open the chat room using the XMPP protocol:
get the Video ActivityPub object, if there is no attachment key, stop. loop through the attachment values (if attachment is not an array, just iterate on this single value) search for an entry with rel === discussion, and with href using the xmpp scheme (that begins with xmpp://) if found, open this xmpp uri with your client, or connect to the XMPP room at that address Additional notes In the ActivityPub object, there is also a peertubeLiveChat entry. Don’t use the content of this entry. This is specific to the livechat plugin, and can be changed or removed in a near future. It is currently required for some endpoint discovery.
Using Podcast RSS feed The livechat plugin adds some data in Podcast RSS feeds under the <podcast:liveItem>, so that the chat can be discovered for live streams.
Info This requires Peertube >= 5.2
Info The <podcast:chat> element is currently only supported for live streams.
This follows the <podcast:chat> proposal.
Warning At the time of the writing, this proposal is in draft status, and the livechat plugin is a Proof-of-concept. Until the proposal is adopted, the specification can change, and the livechat plugin will be adapted accordingly.
Basically, the chat will be declared as tag under on the <podcast:liveItem> element.
By default, here is an example of what you will get:

Translations are handled using the Weblate software, using Framasoft Weblate instance.
Warning Never modify directly files in the languages folder, this could lead to conflicts.
How to Create an account: https://weblate.framasoft.org/accounts/register/ Validate your email and follow the link sent Create your password and setup your account Go to the plugin project page: https://weblate.framasoft.org/projects/peertube-livechat/peertube-plugin-livechat/ Choose the locale you want to translate Just translate missing sentences, or correct the ones that seems incorrect to you. Warning There might be some «very technical» strings. If you are not 100% sure of the meaning, or of your translation, you better not translate it, so it will display in english.
ConverseJS translations This plugin relies on ConverseJS for the chat front-end. ConverseJS has its own translations, on its own weblate instance. You can also translate directly in the code repository. For more information, check ConverseJS translations documentation.
Adding a new locale If you think there is a missing locale, please check first if it is handled in Peertube. If so, you can open an issue to ask for it.
Adding new strings / use translations in the code If you are working on new features, and need new strings, you can create them directly in Weblate. The english version is mandatory. Start with it.
Each string is linked to a key (for example use_chat). Choose an explicit key in english, lower case.
If you have to test new strings without waiting for a Weblate merge, you can modify languages/*.yml files, but avoid to commit these changes (to minimize conflict risks).
Use translations in front-end code Before using a string in front-end, you need to declare a new constant in client/@types/global.d.ts. The constant name must:
start with the prefix “LOC_” use the string key, upper cased you just have to declare its type, not its value For example, to use “use_chat”, you have to declare:
declare const LOC_USE_CHAT: stringThe build-client.js script will read the client/@types/global.d.ts, search for such constants, and load their values from the languages files.
Now, you can simply call peertubeHelpers.translate(LOC_USE_CHAT) in your code.
Use translations in back-end code In theory, the only parts of the backend code where you need localization is the settings declaration and standardized data (ActivityPub, RSS, …). Here we need to get english strings from the translation key.
Note: you should never need another language translation from backend code. Localization must be done on front-end.
There is a lib/loc.ts module providing a loc() function. Just pass it the key to have the english string: loc('diagnostic')'.
Documentation translation The documentation translation is done using the corresponding Weblate component.
There is a specific “Hugo shortcodes” you can use to display an application string. Saying you want to display the name of the button “open_chat_new_window”, you can use this in the documentation markdown file:
{{% livechat_label open_chat_new_window %}}You can also prevent a whole page from being translating by adding livechatnotranslation: true in the Yaml Font Matter section:
--- title: "Third party" description: "Displaying the livechat with 3rd party software." weight: 20 chapter: false livechatnotranslation: true ---Never translate a string in the livechat.en.pot file, it would be ignored. Instead, edit directly the markdown files.
If a string contains a link, you can change it for the correct link in the translated language. For example, for a link to this documentation, you can add the language code in the url.
Some strings are block of code. Don’t translate code. But you can translate comments, or parameters if relevant.
If you are not sure, just don’t translate, and ask what to do.
The tool I use to handle translations for the documentation can have strange behaviours. When I add sentences that looks like other existing sentences, it sometimes copies existing translations. So, when you have translations marked as “to check”, please make sure it doesn’t copy a string that has nothing to do with the english one before validating.
If you are now sure about the context of a string, you can check the string location in the weblate’s right pane, and open the corresponding documentation page. For example, for a string located in the file support/documentation/content/en/documentation/user/streamers.md, the corresponding url is https://livingston.frama.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/documentation/user/streamers/.

Doing so, Peertube admins will be able to define advanced firewall rules.
Warning These rules could be used to run arbitrary code on the server. If you are a hosting provider, and you don’t want to allow Peertube admins to write such rules, you can disable the online editing by creating a disable_mod_firewall_editing file in the plugin directory (plugins/data/peertube-plugin-livechat/disable_mod_firewall_editing). This is opt-out, as Peertube admins can already run arbitrary code just by installing any plugin. You can still use mod_firewall by editing files directly on the server.
Edit rules First, you must enable the feature in the plugin settings.
Just bellow the settings, you will find a “Configure mod_firewall” button. This button will open a configuration page.
Here you can add several configuration files.
You can enable/disable each files.
Files will be loaded in the alphabetical order. You can use a number as prefix to easily choose the order.
Info You can also edit these firewall rules directly on the server, in the plugins/data/peertube-plugin-livechat/prosody/mod_firewall_config/ directory. File names must only contains alphanumerical characters, underscores and hyphens. The extension must be .pfw, or .pfw.disabled if you want to disable a file. Please be sure that the peertube system user has write access to these files, else the web editing interface will fail. Once you have edited these files, you must reload prosody. This can be done by saving the plugin settings, or saving the mod_firewall configuration in the web interface, or by restarting Peertube.
When you save the configuration, the server will automatically reload it, and your rules will apply immediatly. You can check that there is no parsing error in the Prosody error log. To do so, you can read the plugins/data/peertube-plugin-livechat/prosody/prosody.err file, or use the diagnostic tool that will show last Prosody errors.

It is therefore possible to connect to the chats using XMPP client software. This can for example be useful to facilitate moderation operations.
For the user documentation associated with these features, please refer to the user documentation page.
Info Enabling these features requires configuration changes on the server, and on the DNS records. It is not possible to configure this only from the Peertube interface, and it requires some basic system some basic system admin skills.
Login to your Peertube account Warning This feature is not yet available, and will come in a future version of the plugin.
Connection using an external XMPP account To enable this feature, you will need to set up your server and DNS records, so that XMPP clients can find and access the Prosody server that this plugin uses internally.
Plugin settings Start by going to the livechat plugin settings of your instance, then enable the setting “Enable connection to room using external XMPP accounts”. By checking this setting, new settings appear below.
First of all, the “Prosody server to server port” field. This one defaults to 5269, which is the standard port for this service. You can however change to another port, if this is already in use on your server.
Next, the field “Server to server network interfaces” field allows you to specify which network interfaces the server should listen on. The default value “*, ::” indicates to listen on all IP addresses. You can change these values, if you wish to listen on only certain IP addresses. The syntax is explained next to the setting.
For the “Certificate folder” setting, you can leave it empty. In this case, the plugin will automatically generate self-signed certificates. Some XMPP servers may refuse to connect, depending on their configuration. In this case, you can indicate here a path on the server, in which you must place certificates to be used by the module. It is up to you to generate and renew them. See bellow for more information.
Firewall You must open the configured port (5269 by default) on your firewall.
If you are using Docker for your Peertube, you need to modify the docker-compose.yml file to open port 5269 of the peertube container, so that the outer world can connect to it.
DNS You need to add DNS records allowing remote servers to find “room.your_instance.tld” and “external.your_instance.tld” components.
The easiest way to do this is to add SRV records for the “room” and “external” subdomain:
record name: _xmpp-server._tcp.room.your_instance.tld. (replace «your_instance.tld» by your instance uri)
TTL: 3600
class: IN
SRV: 0
priority: 0
weight: 5
port: 5269 (adapt if your changed the default port)
target: your_instance.tld. (replace by your instance uri)
record name: _xmpp-server._tcp.external.your_instance.tld. (replace «your_instance.tld» by your instance uri)
TTL: 3600
class: IN
SRV: 0
priority: 0
weight: 5
port: 5269 (adapt if your changed the default port)
target: your_instance.tld. (replace by your instance uri)
Be careful to keep the dot after “your_instance.tld”.
Using the dig command to check your records, you should get a result similar to this:
$ dig +short _xmpp-server._tcp.room.videos.john-livingston.fr. SRV 0 5 5269 videos.john-livingston.fr. $ dig +short _xmpp-server._tcp.external.videos.john-livingston.fr. SRV 0 5 5269 videos.john-livingston.fr.If you are not using the standard 5269 port, you must also add a SRV record for _xmpp-server._tcp.your_instance.tld. (same as above, just without the room. prefix). Of course, you can also add this record if you use the standard port. It will also work.
Using trusted certificates The self-signed certificates that this plugin uses by default can be rejected by some XMPP servers, for security reasons.
It is possible to use certificates validated by a certification authority. However, this requires advanced system administration knowledge. Indeed, due to the multitude of possible use cases, it is impossible to document all situations here. This documentation will therefore only explain the goal to be reached, and give an example which will only be suitable for a “basic” situation (manual installation of Peertube, using letsencrypt). If you are in another situation (Docker installation, certificates signed by another authority, etc…), you will have to adapt this approach by yourself.
Basic principle It is up to you to generate valid certificates for domains your_instance.tld and room.your_instance.tld. You can use any method supported by Prosody.
You must then place these certificates in a folder that will be accessible to the peertube user, and specify this folder in the plugin setting “Certificate folder”.
Tip If you want to use the ProsodyCtl utility to import certificates, this utility is available (once Peertube is started) using the following command (adapting the path to your Peertube data folder, and replacing “xxx” with the arguments you wish to pass to prosodyctl): sudo -u peertube /var/www/peertube/storage/plugins/data/peertube-plugin-livechat/prosodyAppImage/squashfs-root/AppRun prosodyctl --config /var/www/peertube/storage/plugins/data/peertube-plugin-livechat/prosody/prosody.cfg.lua xxx
The plugin will check once a day to see if any files have been modified in this folder, and reload Prosody if necessary.
Method for the simple case We assume here that your Peertube installation is “classic” (no use of Docker), and that the certificates are generated by letsencrypt, using the certbot tool.
First of all, we’ll have to create a certificate for the subdomain room.your_instance.tld : this is the uri of the MUC (XMPP chat rooms) component. Even if the connections are made on your_instance.tld, we will need a valid certificate for this subdomain.
So start by setting up a DNS entry for room.your_instance.tld, which points to your server. You can use a CNAME entry (or an A entry and a AAAA entry).
Next, we’ll use nginx (already installed for your Peertube) to generate the certbot certificate. We will create a new site. In the file /etc/nginx/site-available/room.peertube, add:
server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name room.your_instance.tld; location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ { default_type "text/plain"; root /var/www/certbot; } location / { return 301 https://your_instance.tld; } }Then enable the site:
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/room.peertube /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ systemc reload nginxThen we prepare the folder in which we will later import the certificates. We assume here that you already have the plugin active. We will create the following folder (if it doesn’t already exist), with the user peertube to make sure there are no permissions issues:
sudo -u peertube mkdir /var/www/peertube/storage/plugins/data/peertube-plugin-livechat/prosody/certsNow you have to configure this folder in the plugin settings, for the parameter “Certificate folders”. It’s important to do this now, otherwise the certificate import script will put the certificates in the wrong folder.
We will configure certbot to import the generated certificates into the Prosody folder. We can use the ProsodyCtl utility packaged in the plugin.
Note: for it to be available, the plugin must have been started at least once.
We will create a file /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/prosody.sh containing:
#!/usr/bin/env sh /var/www/peertube/storage/plugins/data/peertube-plugin-livechat/prosodyAppImage/squashfs-root/AppRun prosodyctl \\ --root \\ --config /var/www/peertube/storage/plugins/data/peertube-plugin-livechat/prosody/prosody.cfg.lua \\ cert import \\ room.your_instance.tld your_instance.tld /etc/letsencrypt/liveThen we ask to generate the certificate:
certbot -d room.videos.john-livingston.frIf certbot offers you several methods to generate the certificate, choose “nginx”.
Normally you should now find the certificates in the configured folder.
Note: the first time you do this, you will have to reload Prosody. The easiest way to do this is to restart Peertube.
Method for the Docker case This method works with the officially supported Docker guide from PeerTube.
First, ensure you create a DNS entry for room.your_instance.tld, which points to your server. You can use a CNAME entry (or an A entry and a AAAA entry). This is necessary for Let’s Encrypt to validate the domain for certificate generation.
Enter the directory where your docker-compose.yml file exists.
Open a shell in the certbot container:
docker exec -it certbot /bin/shRun certbot:
certbotYou will be presented with a series of prompts. Enter 2 for the authentication type:
How would you like to authenticate with the ACME CA? Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel): 2Enter the domain name room.your_instance.tld:
Please enter the domain name(s) you would like on your certificate (comma and/or space separated) (Enter 'c' to cancel): room.your_instance.tldEnter the directory where the PeerTube webserver serves requests for Let’s Encrypt, /var/www/certbot:
Input the webroot for <room.your_instance.tld>: (Enter 'c' to cancel): /var/www/certbotYou should see output like the following:
Successfully received certificate. Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/room.your_instance.tld/fullchain.pem Key is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/room.your_instance.tld/privkey.pemRun the below command inside the certbot container to give read access to the new certs and private keys to the peertube group. Note: This will also make the files readable to the group with id 999 on the host system. Check the groups on your system to assess this as a risk before running this command.
chown -R root:999 /etc/letsencrypt/live; \\ chmod 750 /etc/letsencrypt/live; \\ chown -R root:999 /etc/letsencrypt/archive; \\ chmod 750 /etc/letsencrypt/archive; \\ find /etc/letsencrypt/ -name 'privkey*' -exec chmod 0640 {} \\;Exit the certbot container:
exitModify your docker-compose.yml file, changing the entrypoint line under the certbot service to the following. This is the same as the above, but to be automatically executed after every certificate renewal.
entrypoint: /bin/sh -c "trap exit TERM; while :; do certbot renew --webroot -w /var/www/certbot; chown -R root:999 /etc/letsencrypt/live; chmod 750 /etc/letsencrypt/live; chown -R root:999 /etc/letsencrypt/archive; chmod 750 /etc/letsencrypt/archive; find /etc/letsencrypt/ -name 'privkey*' -exec chmod 0640 {} +; sleep 12h & wait $\${!}; done;"Continuing to modify docker-compose.yml, add the certbot certificate volume into the peertube container. It should look something like this:
volumes: - ./docker-volume/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencryptRestart your services:
docker-compose down; docker-comopse up -dIn the livechat plugin settings from your PeerTube administration settings, set the certificate directory to the following:
/etc/letsencrypt/liveSave the plugin settings and verify Prosody can see the certificates:
docker-compose exec -u peertube \\ peertube \\ /data/plugins/data/peertube-plugin-livechat/prosodyAppImage/squashfs-root/AppRun \\ prosodyctl \\ --config /data/plugins/data/peertube-plugin-livechat/prosody/prosody.cfg.lua \\ check certsTroubleshooting If you can’t make it work, you can use the diagnostic tool (there is a button on top of the plugin settings page), and take a close look on the «Prosody check» section.`,description:"Allow connections using XMPP clients",tags:[],title:"XMPP clients",uri:"/peertube-plugin-livechat/sv/documentation/admin/advanced/xmpp_clients/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Peertube livechat > Documentation > Admin documentation",content:` XMPP clientsAllow connections using XMPP clients

Pull Request must be done on the main branch.
Note Until march 2023, contribution were made on the develop branch. This procedure is now deprecated.
Prerequisite for building this plugin It is highly recommended to be familiar with following concepts:
Git NodeJS NPM Typescript To build the plugin, you must have following packages:
git npm (>=8.x) nodejs (>=14.x) build-essential coreutils wget reuse Please note that this plugin needs an AppImage for the Prosody XMPP server. This AppImage is provided by the Prosody AppImage sideproject. The build-prosody.sh script download binaries attached to this remote repository, and checks that their sha256 hashsum are correct.
Develop Clone the repository, buid the plugin, and create your feature branch:
# Clone the repository. Dont forget the --recursive to clone submodules. git clone https://github.com/JohnXLivingston/peertube-plugin-livechat.git --recursive cd peertube-plugin-livechat # Install NPM dependencies and build the module for the first time: npm install # Build the plugin after a modification: npm run build # If you have a fork from the repository, add it as remote (example): git remote add me git@github.com:MY_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/peertube-plugin-livechat.git # Create a local branch for you developments, and checkout it (example): git checkout my_development # Note: if an issue is associated, use fix_1234 as your branch name (where 1234 is the issue's number) # To propose your modifications, push your branch to your repository (example): git push --set-upstream me my_development # Then go to your github repository with your web browser to propose the Pull Request (see additional instructions below)Once you are ready to show your code to ask for feedback, submit a draft Pull Request. Once you are ready for a code review before merge, submit a Pull Request. In any case, please link your PR to the issues it solves by using the GitHub syntax: “fixes #issue_number”.
The front-end code is in the client folder, the back-end code in server. There are some shared code in shared folder.
For general instructions (developping plugins, building, installation, …), please refer to the Peertube documentation.
You can build the plugin with extra debug features simply by using:
NODE_ENV=dev npm run buildThis plugin is REUSE compliant: it uses SPDX headers to identify licensing information of its source code. More information on the REUSE website. You can use the reuse command line tool to help you update headers. The npm run lint command will use the reuse command to check compliance. Don’t forget to add your copyright information in SPDX headers when you modify some code.
ESBuild vs Typescript This plugin uses ESBuild for frontend code generation, as the official peertube-plugin-quickstart plugin. ESBuild can handle Typescript, but does not check types (see ESBuild documentation). That’s why we first compile Typescript with the -noEmit option, just to check types (check:client:ts in package.json file). Then, if everything is okay, we run ESBuild to generate the compiled javascript.
Debug Mode There is a debug mode for this plugin, that shorten some delay. For example, some log files will rotate every two minutes, instead of once per day. This permit to test more easily certain actions, for which it could normally take hours or days to wait.
To enable this mode, you juste have to create the /var/www/peertube/storage/plugins/data/peertube-plugin-livechat/debug_mode file (replacing /var/www/peertube/storage/ by the correct path on your installation).
The simple existence of this file is sufficient to trigger the debug mode. To make sure it’s taken into account, you can restart your Peertube instance.
This file can contain some JSON to enable more advanced options. To have a list of existing parameters, check server/lib/debug.ts. Restart Peertube after each content modification.
Warning Don’t enable this mode on a production server, neither on a public server. This could cause security issues.
Restart Prosody When debug mode is enabled, you can restart Prosody using this API call: http://your_instance.tld/plugins/livechat/router/api/restart_prosody. This call don’t need any authentificaiton. It can be done from a command line, for example using curl http://your_instance.tld/plugins/livechat/router/api/restart_prosody.
Prosody debugger It is possible to connect the Prosody AppImage to a remote debugger using MobDebug.
To do so, you have to setup MobDebug in a folder that can be accessed by the peertube user. Then, add this in the debub_mode file:
{ "debug_prosody": { "debugger_path": "/the_path_to_mobdebug/src", "host": "localhost", "port": "8172" } }host and port are optional. debugger_path must point to the folder where the MobDebug .lua file is.
Restart Peertube.
Start your debugger server.
For Prosody to connect to the debugger, call the API http://your_instance.tld/plugins/livechat/router/api/restart_prosody?debugger=true. This call does not need any authentication. It can be done from a command line, for example with curl http://your_instance.tld/plugins/livechat/router/api/restart_prosody?debugger=true. You can even configure your debug server to launch this request automatically.
Prosody will then restart, connecting to the debugger.
Quick dev environment using Docker There is a tutorial, in french, on the Peertube forum that explains how to quickly build a dev env using Docker.
A repo was made out of it, check out pt-plugin-dev.
Note: for an unknown reason, Prosody can’t resolve containers DNS address when using the lua-unbound library. There is a dirty hack in the plugin: just create a /data/plugins/data/peertube-plugin-livechat/no_lua_unbound file in your docker-volumes, then restart containers.
Quickly rebuild and install the plugin When you do modification, you don’t have to always rebuild the full project, and reinstall the plugin on your dev environment. You can build only the modified part (for example, if you only modified client files: npm run build:client). Check the package.json files for available build scripts.
When the plugin is already installed on your dev instance, and you haven’t changed any dependency, you can quickly install your work by following these steps:
re-build necessary parts of the plugin (client, styles, …), overwrite the data/plugins/node_modules/peertube-plugin-livechat/dist/ content of your dev instance by the content of the plugin’s dist folder, change recursively plugins/node_modules/peertube-plugin-livechat/dist/ files owner to your peertube user, restart your instance. Performance tests The livechat-perf-test repository contains some tools to make performance tests. It can be used to evaluate code improvements, or find bottlenecks.`,description:"Develop",tags:[],title:"Develop",uri:"/peertube-plugin-livechat/sv/contributing/develop/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Peertube livechat > Documentation > User documentation",content:`OBS is a popular Free And Open Source streaming software, with advanced capacities for your live streams. In the current page, you will find some advices to handle your live chats using OBS.
OBS Overlay You can easily include the chat in your video stream.
You can use the “Dela chattlänk” feature to generate an URL to your chat. This button should be near the chat if you are the video owner (unless it was desactivated by your server admins).
Check the “Skrivskyddad” checkbox in the modal.
Then use this link as a “web browser source” in OBS.
You can use the “Genomskinlig bakgrund (för integrering i video, genom exempelvis OBD)” option to have a transparent background in OBS. If you want to customize the background transparency, you can add this CSS in your OBS browser source’s settings:
:root { --livechat-transparent: rgba(255 255 255 / 90%) !important; } In the previous CSS snippet, you can of course change the color or the transparency, by adapting the color values.
Note: you can entirely customize chat colors. This is undocumented yet, but you can try this: in the modal, check «use curent theme colors», then you can try to manually change color values in the URL. You must use valid CSS color values, and they must be properly URL encoded.
OBS Dock Info This feature comes with the livechat plugin version 10.1.0. Warning This feature can be disabled by the instance’s adminitrators.
You can use OBS “Custom browser docks” to integrate the chat in your OBS while you are streaming. The livechat plugin offers a way to create long term token that can identify you automatically to join the chat, so you don’t have to enter your password in OBS.
To do so, just use the “Dela chattlänk” feature, and open the “Dock” tab. From there, you can create a new token using the “+” button.
Then, copy the url, and use the “Docks / Custom browser docks” menu from your OBS to add a dock with this URL.
Once you have done, you will have a new dock connected to the chat with your account.
Tip Tokens are valid to join any chat room. You don’t have to generate separate tokens for each of your rooms. You can also customize the nickame that will be used by changing the n parameter in the url.
Don’t share these links to anyone, as it would allow them to connect as yourself.
If a token is compromised, or no more needed, you can revoke them.
Info These tokens can be used for other purposes, as connecting to your account with XMPP bots or clients. This feature is not documented yet, and not officially supported. So use with care.
Mixing multiple chats in your live stream You can use the social_stream browser extension to mix multiple chat source (from Peertube, Twitch, Youtube, Facebook, …) and include their contents in your live stream. The compatibility with this plugin was added in recent versions.`,description:"Documentation to stream the chat content using OBS.",tags:[],title:"OBS",uri:"/peertube-plugin-livechat/sv/documentation/user/obs/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Peertube livechat > Contributing",content:`General information Always inform the community before working (by creating a new issue, or commenting an existing one).

Documentation work has to be merged in the main branch.
The documentation source code is in the support/documentation/content folder.
The documentation is generated using Hugo. You have to install it on your computer if you want to preview your work.
The minimum required version for Hugo is 0.121.0. It was tested using version 0.132.2.
The used theme is hugo-theme-relearn. You should read its documentation before starting editing the documentation.
When a new plugin version is released, or when documentation is updated, plugin maintainers will merge the main branch to the documentation branch. This will trigger github and gitlab pipelines, and update published documentation.
Translations The principal language is english (en code).
The support/documentation/content/en folder contains only english documentation files.
Documentation is translated using Weblate (see the translation documentation). To do so, we use the po4a tool, as we will se later in this page.
Add a new language In the support/documentation/config.toml file, please copy and modify the [Languages.fr] section.
If the translations are not complete, it does not matter, english will be used for missing strings.
Preview To preview your modifications, just run:
hugo serve -s support/documentation/ Then open your browser on the address http://localhost:1313/peertube-plugin-livechat/. This page will automatically refresh on each modification.
Update localization files and generate documentation translations For now, you only have the english version. To update documentation strings, and generate translations, you have to run the doc-translate.sh script.
To do so, make sure you have po4a (version >= 0.69) installed on your computer.
Warning Some linux distro (like Debian Bullseye for example) have too old version of po4a. Please make sure to install a compatible version. If you are using Debian Bullseye for example, you can download the Bookworm po4a.deb file from https://packages.debian.org, and install it manually.
To handle translations, just do:
npm run doc:translate You can then preview the result using hugo serve -s support/documentation/, and using the language selector.
Write documentation Just edit the english files in support/documentation/content/en.
Then, before commiting, always run npm run doc:translate, so that changes in english files can be propagated to the support/documentation/po/livechat.en.pot file.
You can use the livechat_label short code to use application strings. See here: Documentation translation.
It is possible to prevent a file from beeing translating, using livechatnotranslation: true in the Yaml Font Matter section. See here: Documentation translation.
Please use the livechatnotranslation option for technical documentation. We don’t want technical documentation to be translated, to avoid issues because of a wrong translation.
To facilitate translators work, avoid making too long paragraphs.
For now, it is not possible to use Markdown tables: the translation tools will break them.
Warning There may be links to this documentation elsewhere on the web. Try not to change the urls of the documentation pages. Or at the very least, put links to the new location on the previous url.
When a new feature is released, you can use the livechat_version_notice short code to display an infobox with the version with which the features is available. This short code takes the version number as parameter. Here is an example:
Info This feature comes with the livechat plugin version 12.0.0. What if I can’t use hugo and/or po4a? Just edit english markdown files, and specify that you can’t build translations when you make your Pull Request.

This page describes these data.
prosody The prosody folder is used by the Prosody XMPP server to store its data and logs.
prosodyAppImage This plugin uses the Prosoxy XMPP server in background. This server code is embedded as an AppImage.
When the plugin starts, it deflate this AppImage in the prosodyAppImage folder.
serverInfos To handle federation between Peertube instances, the plugin needs to store some information concerning remote instances (available protocols, …).
The plugin stores these data in the serverInfos/instance_uri folder (where instance_uri is replaced by the instance uri).
In each instance’s folder, there can be these files:
last-update: json file containing the timestamp of the last information update. So we can avoid refreshing too often. ws-s2s: if the server allows XMPP S2S Websocket connections, here are the endpoint information s2s: if the server allows direct XMPP S2S connections, here are the port and url information videoInfos To handle federation the plugin needs to store some information about remote videos.
So, each time we open a new remote chat, a file videoInfos/remote/instance_uri/video_uuid.json is created (where instance_uri is the origin instance uri, and video_uuid is the video uuid).
This JSON files contain some data about the remote chat (is it enabled, are anonymous users authorized, which protocol can we use, …). These data can then be read by the Prosody server to connect to the remote chat.
Moreover, when the current instance builds such data for local videos, it stores it in videoInfos/local/video_uuid.json (where video_uuid is the video uuid).
channelConfigurationOptions The channelConfigurationOptions folder contains JSON files describing channels advanced configuration. Filenames are like 1.json where 1 is the channel id. The content of the files are similar to the content sent by the front-end when saving these configuration.
room-channel/muc_domain.json Some parts of the plugin need a quick way to get the channel id from the room Jabber ID, or the all room Jabber ID from a channel id. We won’t use SQL queries, because we only want such information for video that have a chatroom.
So we will store in the room-channel/muc_domain.json file (where muc_domain is the current MUC domain, something like room.instance.tld) a JSON object representing these relations).
In the JSON object, keys are the channel ID (as string), values are arrays of strings representing the rooms JIDs local part (without the MUC domain).
When a chatroom is created, the corresponding entry will be added.
Here is a sample file:
{ "1": [ "8df24108-6e70-4fc8-b1cc-f2db7fcdd535" ] }This file is loaded at the plugin startup into an object that can manipulate these data.
So we can easily list all rooms for a given channel id or get the channel id for a room JID (Jabber ID).
Note: we include the MUC domain (room.instance.tld) in the filename in case the instance domain changes. In such case, existing rooms could get lost, and we want a way to ignore them to avoid gettings errors.
Note: there could be some inconsistencies, when video or rooms are deleted. The code must take this into account, and always double check room or channel existence. There will be some cleaning batch, to delete deprecated files.
bot/muc_domain The bot/muc_domain (where muc_domain is the current MUC domain) folder contains configuration files that are read by the moderation bot. This bot uses the xmppjs-chat-bot package.
Note: we include the MUC domain (room.instance.tld) in the dirname in case the instance domain changes. In such case, existing rooms could get lost, and we want a way to ignore them to avoid gettings errors.
bot/muc_domain/moderation.json The bot/muc_domain/moderation.json file contains the moderation bot global configuration. This bot uses the xmppjs-chat-bot package, see it’s README file for more information.
Note: this includes the bot username and password. Don’t let it leak.
bot/muc_domain/rooms The bot/muc_domain/rooms folder contains room configuration files. See the xmppjs-chat-bot package help for more information.
emojis/channel The emojis/channel folder contains custom emojis definitions for channels.
For example, the channel 1 will contain:
emojis/channel/1/definition.json: the JSON file containing the emojis definitions emojis/channel/1/files/42.png: N image files (png, jpg, …), using numbers as filenames. tokens The tokens folder contains long term token to connect to the chat.

Requirements PeerTube plugin livechat version 3.2.0 or later. Matterbridge version 1.22.4 or later. The easiest is if the PeerTube instance and Matterbridge run on the same server.
Internal connections only (basic) You will need to enable Enable client to server connections in the livechat plugin settings.
This will allow localhost XMPP clients to connect to the Prosody XMPP server.
You may need to add some line to your /etc/hosts:
127.0.0.1 anon.example.org room.example.org Replace example.org by your actual instance domain name. Afterwards you can continue with the Matterbridge configuration below.
Allow external connections (advanced) By default, the internal Prosody XMPP server only listens on localhost (127.0.0.1).
On livechat versions >= 10.1.0 a new option call Client to server network interfaces was added to allow changing this.
It allows to add a list of IPs to listen on, coma separated (spaces will be stripped).
You can also use * to listen on all IPv4 interfaces, and :: for all IPv6. Doing so allows external access to the client to server interface.
Then you need to open the C2S port (by default 52822, but check the plugin settings to get the current value) in your firewall so that it can be reached from the internet. If you don’t want to use C2S connections for anything else than your Matterbridge service, you should restrict access to this port to your Matterbridge server IP.
You also need to add DNS records (A and AAAA) for anon.example.org and room.example.org (replace example.org by your actual domain name).
In case you are using a port other than 5222 (XMPP standard port) you also need to set the xmpp-client SRV record to the correct port.
Configurating Matterbridge In the version 1.22.4, Matterbridge added support for XMPP anonymous connections needed to connect to the built-in prosody.
So in the TOML config file put:
[xmpp.mypeertube] Anonymous=true Server="anon.example.org:52822" Muc="room.example.org" Nick="Matterbridge" RemoteNickFormat="[{PROTOCOL}] <{NICK}> " NoTLS=true Replace example.org by your actual instance domain name. Replace 52822 by the actual port if you changed it. mypeertube can be replaced by another name. Using peertube as the Nick will provide put PeerTube icon for overlay messages, can be also done with overlay config modification. The setting NoTLS=true allows connecting to a server with self-signed certificates. Now you can add this account to gateways and bridge specific live-chat channels.
Info This documentation use an anonymous account to connect the bridge to the chat. But since the livechat v10.1.0, there is a new way to generate long term authentication token, that allows to connect using your account. This is used for OBS docks.

XEP: MUC Slow Mode Abstract: This specification describes a way to rate limit messages a single user can send to a MUC room, from the room configuration to the server and client handling of such a feature.
Author: John Livingston
1. Introduction There are some contexts in which you want to be able to rate limit MUC messages. This could have multiple motivations: avoid flooding, garantee a better readability of the room when there are hundreds of active users, …
This specification propose a new option to MUC rooms, allowing room owners to fix a duration that users MUST wait between two messages. We will also specify how the server MUST reject messages send too quickly, and how clients SHOULD handle this feature (by preventing users to send messages without waiting the delay to be over).
2. Terminology Clients: the client software used by end-users to join MUC rooms.
Moderator: A room role that is usually associated with room admins but that can be granted to non-admins.
MUC: The multi-user chat protocol for text-based conferencing.
Participant: An occupant who does not have admin status; in a moderated room, a participant is further defined as having voice (in contrast to a visitor). A participant has a role of “participant”.
Role: A temporary position or privilege level within a room, distinct from a user’s long-lived affiliation with the room; the possible roles are “moderator”, “participant”, and “visitor” (it is also possible to have no defined role). A role lasts only for the duration of an occupant’s visit to a room. See XEP-0045.
Room administrator: A user empowered by the room owner to perform administrative functions such as banning users; however, a room administrator is not allowed to change the room configuration or to destroy the room. An admin has an affiliation of “admin”. See XEP-0045.
Room owner: users that have special access to a room, and that can edit room configuration. See XEP-0045 - Owner Use Cases.
Service Discovery Extensions: XEP-0128: Service Discovery Extensions.
Slow Mode: feature allowing to rate limit user messages in a MUC room.
Slow Mode duration: when the Slow Mode feature is active, specifies the duration, in seconds, users must wait between two text messages.
3. Requirements This document addresses the following requirements:
How to allow room owners to enable and configure the feature by editing the MUC room discovery information. How to enable and configure the feature without allowing room owners to change the configuration. How the server MUST reject messages that does not respect the parameters. How clients SHOULD handle rooms with such feature enabled. 4. MUC configuration 4.1 Activating Slow Mode in the MUC Room configuration Your implementation MAY allow the Slow Mode feature to be set room by room, by its owners.
If room owners can configure the Slow Mode feature, the server MUST add a muc#roomconfig_slow_mode_duration field in the room configuration form.
This field MUST have its type equal to text-single.
This field SHOULD use Data Forms Validation, having its datatype equal to xs:integer.
The value of the field MUST be a positive integer, so you MUST add a range validation, as described in RFC-0122.
0 value means that the slow mode is disabled for this room. Any positive value is the duration, in seconds, users must wait between two messages.
Here is an example of response the server could send when a client is querying room configuration form:
<iq from='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit' id='config1' to='crone1@shakespeare.lit/desktop' type='result'> <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#owner'> <x xmlns='jabber:x:data' type='form'> <title>Configuration for "coven" Room</title> <instructions> Complete this form to modify the configuration of your room. </instructions> <field type='hidden' var='FORM_TYPE'> <value>http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#roomconfig</value> </field> <field var='muc#roomconfig_slow_mode_duration' type='text-single' label='Slow Mode (0=disabled, any positive integer= users can send a message every X seconds.)' > <validate xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/xdata-validate' datatype='xs:integer'> <range min='0'/> </validate> <value>20</value> </field> <!-- and any other field... --> </x> </query> </iq>If the configuration is changed, the server SHOULD send a status code 104, as specified in XEP-0045 - Notification of configuration changes.
4.2 Client discovering The feature can be enabled on a room:
by the room owner, if your implementation allow them to set this option by a server-wide parameter In other words: you can enable this feature, without adding the field in the room configuration form. This allows for example server admins to apply a rate limit server-wide, or to set the slow mode programmatically on any wanted criteria (number of users in the room, current server load, room context, …).
In any case, to allow clients to discover that the feature is active, the server MUST respond on room information queries by adding a muc#roominfo_slow_mode_duration field. This field type MUST be text-single, and its value MUST be a positive integer.
0 value means that the slow mode is disabled for this room. Any positive value is the duration, in seconds, users must wait between two messages. Any invalid (non-positive integer) value sent by the server MUST be considered as equal to 0 (in case of a bad implementation).
Here is an example of response the server could send when a client is querying room information:
<iq from='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit' id='ik3vs715' to='hag66@shakespeare.lit/pda' type='result'> <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info'> <identity category='conference' name='The place to be' type='text'/> <feature var='http://jabber.org/protocol/muc'/> <x xmlns='jabber:x:data' type='result'> <field var='FORM_TYPE' type='hidden'> <value>http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#roominfo</value> </field> <field var='muc#roominfo_slow_mode_duration' type='text-single'> <value>2</value> </field> <!-- and any other field... --> </x> </query> </iq>If the slow mode duration has changed (either because the room configuration was modified, or because a server parameter has changed), the server SHOULD send a status code 104, as specified in XEP-0045 - Notification of configuration changes.
5. Server-side rate limiting When the Slow Mode is enabled, server MUST NOT accept two consecutive messages from the same user, to the same room, until the slow mode duration has elapsed. Only messages containing at least one <body/> element must be taking into account (to avoid counting chatstate messages for example).
Room administrators and owners MUST NOT be rate limited.
If a user bypass the limit, the server MUST reply an error stanza, that respects RFC 6120, especially:
error_type MUST be wait, as described in RFC 6120 - Stanzas error - Syntax, error_condition MUST be policy-violation, as described in RFC 6120 - Stanzas error - Defined Stream Error Conditions, the stanza SHOULD contain a <text> element explaining why the message was rejected, and this message SHOULD mention the slow mode duration so that user can understand why they can’t post their message. Here is an example or error stanza:
<message xmlns="jabber:client" type="error" to="crone1@shakespeare.lit/desktop" id="528df978-aa6b-422a-b987-056a810c4733" from="coven@chat.shakespeare.lit" > <error type="wait"> <policy-violation xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas" /> <text xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas"> You have exceeded the limit imposed by the slow mode in this room. You have to wait 2 seconds between messages. Please try again later </text> </error> </message>6. Client handling When a participant joins a room, the client SHOULD request room information as described in section “4.2 Client discovering”, and look for the muc#roominfo_slow_mode_duration field.
If this field is present, and contains a valid strictly positive integer value, the client SHOULD display an information somewhere, to tell users that there is a slow mode limitation that applies to this room. This information MAY also be displayed to users for which the rate limit does not apply (administrators, owners, …).
Moreover, each time a participant sends a text message, the client SHOULD prevent the user to send another message before the timeout is passed. This MAY be done either by disabling the input field, or the submit button. If the user has at least the administrator acces level, the client SHOULD NOT disable the input field or the submit button.
To avoid some frustrating behaviour, in case there is some lag on the server for example, the client MAY start counting time after receiving the message echo. Indeed, if the first message is processed with some delay by the server, it could consider that the duration is not passed yet when receiving the next one.
7. Security Considerations As a same user can join a room with multiple sessions and/or nicknames, the server MUST use the appropriate key to identify the account, and apply the same limits to all user’s sessions.

mod_muc_polls Prosody module on the backend polls Converse plugin on the frontend Backend mod_muc_polls is a Prosody modules that implements polls in MUC. This module could be used on any Prosody server, and has no code specific to the livechat plugin.
The way this module works could be standardized one day, by writing a XEP.
Poll creation This module adds the http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#x-poll disco features on muc-disco#info.
Room’s owner and admin can retrieve a http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#x-poll form by sending the relevant iq query. This forms contains relevant fields (the poll question, the duration, choices, …). Once the form submitted, a new poll is created. Any previous existing poll will end (if not already ended).
The current poll is stored in room._data.current_poll.
For now, any ended poll is not kept.
Poll starts When a poll is started, a groupchat message is broadcasted in the MUC room. This message is sent in the name of the poll creator (same from, same occupant-id). This message contains the question, the different choices, and some instructions (in english).
This message also contains some specific XML tags. These tags could be use by any compatible client to display the poll as they want.
Here an Example of this start message:
<message id='25Plgjj2TdemFuomNuKZ9bxRQFLbiVHwc8_4' to='root@p1.localhost/converse.js-117702469' xmlns='jabber:client' from='5dd144b2-3c24-4cbc-a34e-143e951ecf50@room.p1.localhost/Root' type='groupchat'> <body>The poll question 1: Choice 1 label 2: Choice 2 label Send a message with an exclamation mark followed by your choice number to vote. Example: !1 </body> <occupant-id id='yoXY0/DaHd03MpGsc+ayjEFZ5UIWt6JmrxC+6HPz4qM=' xmlns='urn:xmpp:occupant-id:0'/> <x-poll id='_eZQ4j4YLHTK' xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#x-poll-message' end='1720177157' votes='0'> <x-poll-question>The poll question</x-poll-question> <x-poll-choice choice='1' votes='0'>Choice 1 label</x-poll-choice> <x-poll-choice choice='2' votes='0'>Choice 2 label</x-poll-choice> </x-poll> <stanza-id xmlns='urn:xmpp:sid:0' id='dOASuopT9kW5OgAKvhZo0Irm' by='5dd144b2-3c24-4cbc-a34e-143e951ecf50@room.p1.localhost'/> </message>Note: the end attribute is the poll end date timestamp. The votes attributes are the number of votes (total on x-poll and per choice on each x-poll-choice tag). The choice attribute is the key to use to vote for this choice (choice='1' can by voted by sending !1).
Poll votes Users can then vote by sending messages in the room, using the format “!1”.
These groupchat messages will be intercepted by the module, and counted as votes.
If the “anonymous votes” feature is enabled, vote will be taken into account, but the message will be bounced with an error saying: “Your vote is taken into account. Votes are anonymous, they will not be shown to other participants.”
This means that you can vote with any XMPP clients!
If an occupant votes multiple times, their vote will be updated.
If an occupant is muted (has visitor role), votes won’t be counted.
When there are new votes, messages are broadcated so that compatible clients can update the current vote progress. These messages are debounced: the module waits 5 seconds after a vote to send the update message, and only send one for all votes that were done in those 5 seconds. These messages are groupchat message without body, and with some specific urn:xmpp:hints. They contains the x-poll tag with same meta data as above. The message is also sent as the poll creator (from and occupant-id).
Here is an example:
<message id='jm9dsXD73eXxlAP2M4dOhay7oXBlQb91LVBf' to='root@p1.localhost/converse.js-117702469' xmlns='jabber:client' from='5dd144b2-3c24-4cbc-a34e-143e951ecf50@room.p1.localhost/Root' type='groupchat'> <occupant-id id='yoXY0/DaHd03MpGsc+ayjEFZ5UIWt6JmrxC+6HPz4qM=' xmlns='urn:xmpp:occupant-id:0'/> <no-copy xmlns='urn:xmpp:hints'/> <no-store xmlns='urn:xmpp:hints'/> <no-permanent-store xmlns='urn:xmpp:hints'/> <x-poll id='06yCKW_hoZSx' xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#x-poll-message' end='1720177925' votes='1'> <x-poll-question>The poll question</x-poll-question> <x-poll-choice choice='1' votes='1'>Choice 1 label</x-poll-choice> <x-poll-choice choice='2' votes='0'>Choice 2 label</x-poll-choice> </x-poll> </message>Note: Standards XMPP clients won’t be able to show the progress.
When a user joins the MUC, a similar message will be sent to this user (and this user only, to the new occupant session to be more specific). This is done so that any compatible client can immediatly show the poll.
Note: clients should ignored x-poll data from archived messages, and only consider data coming from unarchived messages. Otherwise they could show some outdated data.
Poll end When the poll ends, a new groupchat message is broadcasted in the room.
Here is an example:
<message id='GVqv1YcwI0GZb0myKhmtEqRa9fvWlCbDdF7R' to='root@p1.localhost/converse.js-117702469' xmlns='jabber:client' from='5dd144b2-3c24-4cbc-a34e-143e951ecf50@room.p1.localhost/Root' type='groupchat'> <body>The poll question This poll is now over. 1: Choice 1 label 2: Choice 2 label </body> <occupant-id id='yoXY0/DaHd03MpGsc+ayjEFZ5UIWt6JmrxC+6HPz4qM=' xmlns='urn:xmpp:occupant-id:0'/> <x-poll id='_eZQ4j4YLHTK' votes='5' xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#x-poll-message' end='1720177157' over='' > <x-poll-question>The poll question</x-poll-question> <x-poll-choice choice='1' votes='3'>Choice 1 label</x-poll-choice> <x-poll-choice choice='2' votes='2'>Choice 2 label</x-poll-choice> </x-poll> <stanza-id xmlns='urn:xmpp:sid:0' id='CwiijSxawB8QOP4NN-Li6jP0' by='5dd144b2-3c24-4cbc-a34e-143e951ecf50@room.p1.localhost'/> </message>Please note the over attributes that indicated that the poll is over.
If users are voting just after the poll ends (less than 30 seconds after the poll end), and the vote is anonymous, their votes will be bounced, to avoid leaking votes for late users.
Security Following tags will be stripped of any incoming groupchat message: x-poll, x-poll-question, x-poll-choice. This is to avoid any poll spoofing.
Fronted The poll Converse plugin does multiple things.
It checks for the http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#x-poll disco feature to show the “create poll” button.
It uses standards XMPP forms to get the poll creation form and submit it.
It uses the parseMUCMessage hook to check if messages have x-poll data.
If so, and if message are not archived, it creates or updates the poll banner.
When clicking on a choice in the banner, it just sends a message in the chat ("!1" for example).
As the backend does no localization, it also translate on the fly the english sentences coming from the backend (in the form definition, in poll start/end message, and in bounce/error messages).`,description:"Polls technical documentation",tags:[],title:"Polls",uri:"/peertube-plugin-livechat/sv/technical/polls/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Peertube livechat > Technical documentation",content:`You can set terms & conditions on the instance level (called “global terms”), or at the streamers’ channels level (called “muc terms”, as it is related to muc rooms).
Backend The mod_muc_peertubelivechat_terms prosody modules handles the terms configuration.
It has a configuration option for the global terms. It also adds muc terms in the room data.
When a new occupant session is opened, this modules sends them messages containing the global and muc terms (if set).
Here is an example of sent messages:
<message xmlns="jabber:client" id="_iRSEs061gi5GBjF7zGh7f-M" type="groupchat" to="root@p1.localhost/QH1H89H1" from="8df24108-6e70-4fc8-b1cc-f2db7fcdd535@room.p1.localhost/Peertube"> <body>The global terms.</body> <x-livechat-terms type="global" /> <delay xmlns="urn:xmpp:delay" stamp="2024-06-25T11:02:25Z" /> <stanza-id by="8df24108-6e70-4fc8-b1cc-f2db7fcdd535@room.p1.localhost" xmlns="urn:xmpp:sid:0" id="InoL5fonvOoR8X9gOlAYsz_N" /> <no-copy xmlns='urn:xmpp:hints'/> <no-store xmlns='urn:xmpp:hints'/> <no-permanent-store xmlns='urn:xmpp:hints'/> </message> <message xmlns="jabber:client" id="_iRSEs061gi5GBjF7zGh7f-M" type="groupchat" to="root@p1.localhost/QH1H89H1" from="8df24108-6e70-4fc8-b1cc-f2db7fcdd535@room.p1.localhost/Peertube"> <body>The muc terms.</body> <x-livechat-terms type="muc" /> <delay xmlns="urn:xmpp:delay" stamp="2024-06-25T11:02:25Z" /> <stanza-id by="8df24108-6e70-4fc8-b1cc-f2db7fcdd535@room.p1.localhost" xmlns="urn:xmpp:sid:0" id="InoL5fonvOoR8X9gOlAYsz_N" /> <no-copy xmlns='urn:xmpp:hints'/> <no-store xmlns='urn:xmpp:hints'/> <no-permanent-store xmlns='urn:xmpp:hints'/> </message>Notice the x-livechat-terms tag.
Standard XMPP clients will show these messages as standard message.
Message are sent from a “service nickname”: this occupant does not exist. The service nickname is an option of the module (livechat use “Peertube”, hard coded for now). This nickname is reserved, no-one can spoof it (the module will bounce any request to use this nickname). We must do so, because without nickname, some XMPP clients won’t show the messages (tested with Gajim).
We also add a delay tag, to trick the moderation bot (see comments in code). This also ensure clients will not drop the message because there is no occupant with this name.
We also add some urn:xmpp:hints to avoid storing or copying these messages.
When muc terms are updated, the new terms will be broadcasted.
To avoid anyone spoofing terms & conditions, incoming message stanza are filtered, and any x-livechat-terms tag will be removed.
Message history is disabled for message containing the x-livechat-terms, so that messages broadcasted when the terms change are not stored by muc_mam modume (“Message Archiving Management”).
Frontend For standard XMPP clients, terms will be shown as delayed messages.
For the livechat frontend, there is a livechat-converse-terms Converse plugin that will intercept these messages, and prevent them to be shown in the chat history.
It will also create infobox at the top of the chat to display the terms content. If muc terms are updated, the new terms will be shown.
Users can hide the terms. To remember that a user has already hidden the terms, we store the content in localStorage. We will only show terms again if the content in this localStorage changes. We do so for both global terms and muc terms, in two separate localStorage keys. The keys in localstorage does not depends on the room JID or the origin peertube instance. This means that message will be shown again:
if terms are modified if the user switch to another channel if the user switch to a video from a different peertube instance `,description:"Terms&Conditions implementation",tags:[],title:"Terms&Conditions",uri:"/peertube-plugin-livechat/sv/technical/terms/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Peertube livechat",content:`If you have new feature requests, bugs, or difficulties to setup the plugin, you can use the Github issue tracker.

The present document describes how this is implemented.
Basics This features relies on XEP-0060: Publish-Subscribe. This XEP provide a way to store and retrieve items, and to receive push notifications when an item is created/deleted/modified.
There is a Prosody Module, mod_pubsub_peertubelivechat, to implement some specific use of the pubsub mechanism.
This module is also used for Moderator Notes.
We use the JID+NodeID addressing to specify some nodes related to each MUC room. The JID is the MUC room JID, the NodeID is functionnality we want to address.
This modules implement the “livechat-tasks” node, to handle tasks and task lists.
The “livechat-tasks” node contains two type of objects: Task and TaskList (XML Namespaces: urn:peertube-plugin-livechat:tasklist and urn:peertube-plugin-livechat:task). Tasks have an attribute containing their task list id.
On the front-end, we have the livechat-converse-tasks plugin for ConverseJS.
Workflow Here is the basic workflow used to subscribe to tasks/task-lists, and receive existing items.
the browsers connect to the chat, and ConverseJS uses the XMPP discovery to get the room features. mod_pubsub_peertubelivechat declares two features: urn:peertube-plugin-livechat:tasklist and urn:peertube-plugin-livechat:task. the browsers detect these feature, and checks that the user has admin or owner affiliation on the MUC component. if not, won’t display the Task Application, and stops here. if yes, we will continue: display the Task Application. Create a new PubSubManager object, that will subscribe to the pubsub node. The backend receives the subscription request, test user rights (must be owner/admin on the MUC), and adds the user to the subscribers. Note: a user with multiple browsers tabs will send multiple subscription requests, but this is not an issue. If the node did not exist, the backend automatically created it, and use the MUC name to create a first task-list with that name. Once subscribed, the frontend will request all current entries. The backend tests rights, and send all node entries. On the frontend, the PubSubManager handles the response by dispatching received items to the correct frontend component. Note: on the backend side, we subscribe all users with the “publisher” affiliation level. This allows them to publish items, but not change the node configuration.
Here is the worflow to create/modify/delete items:
the frontend send a publish request. backend checks rights. backend sends notifications to all subscribers, including the current users. On the front-end PubSubManager receives the notification, and dispatch it to the relevant component. Unsubscribing When users leaves a MUC room, they are automatically unsubscribed from the “livechat-tasks” node related to this room.
When users lose the owner/admin affiliation, they are removed from the “livechat-tasks” node subscriptions.
Items Here we describes the content of node items.

We use the JID+NodeID addressing to specify some nodes related to each MUC room. The JID is the MUC room JID, the NodeID is functionnality we want to address.
This modules implement the “livechat-notes” node, to handle moderator notes.
The “livechat-notes” node contains one type of objects: Note (XML Namespaces: urn:peertube-plugin-livechat:note).
On the front-end, we have the livechat-converse-notes plugin for ConverseJS.
Workflow / Unsubscribing This is basically the same as for Tasks.
Items Here we describes the content of note items.
Item tag: note XML Namespace: urn:peertube-plugin-livechat:note item attributes: order: the order of the note in the note list item childs: description: the text content of the note note-about: an optional tag, if the note is associated to a participant The note-about tag, if present, has following structure:

When you create or modify a Peertube live, there is a “plugin settings” tab:
In the “plugin settings” tab, there is a “Använd chatt” checkbox. Just check or uncheck it to enable or disable the chat associated to your video.
Tip There can be other settings in this tab, depending on plugins installed on your Peertube instance.
Per channel chat On the instance level, Peertube’s administrators can choose if chat rooms are unique per video, or if there will be an unique chat room per channel. Please contact your instance’s administrators for more information on how they configure the livechat plugin.
Share the chat On top of the chat, there is a “Dela chattlänk” button.
This button opens a popup, where you can obtain an url to join the chat. This url can be shared.
The “Embed” tab provide some links to embed the chat in websites, or in your live stream.
You can customize some options:
Skrivskyddad: you will only be able to read the chat, not write. This is useful to include the chat content in your live stream (see the OBS documentation). Använd valda temafärger: if checked, your current theme colors will be added to the url, so that any user that opens the link will have the same color set. Skapa en iframe för att bädda in chatten på en webbplats: instead of an url, you will obtain an HTML snippet that you can add to your website to embed the chat. For more information on the “Dock” tab, check the OBS documentation.
In the “Webb” tab, the provided url opens the chat in the Peertube interface. You can share this link to other users to invite them to join the chat.
The “Dela chattlänk” popup can also contain a “Anslut med XMPP” tab. This will only be available if your instance’s administators have enabled an correctly configured this option. Using this option, you can provide a link to join the chat using any XMPP client software. Using such softwares can for example facilitate moderation actions.
Moderation Please refer to the moderation documentation.
Include the chat in your video stream Please refer to the OBS documentation.
Chat persistence By default, the chat is persistent. This means that the room content will be kept for a while. User joining will see messages posted before their arrival.
You can change the persistence behaviour. Open the chat dropdown menu, and click on “Configure”.
There are several options that can be changed.
You can for example set the default and maximum number of messages to return to 0, so that new incomers won’t see any previously sent message.
You can also uncheck “enable archiving”: if unchecked, messages will be pruned if the server restarts.
By unchecking “Persistent”, the room will be cleared if there is no more participant.
Delete the chat content If you want to delete the chat content, open the chat dropdown menu, then click on “Destroy”. A popup will open, asking a confirmation.
The chat will be automatically recreated each time someone tries to join it as long as the video exists, and has the “Använd chatt” feature activated.`,description:"Some basics about how to setup and use the chat for your live stream",tags:[],title:"Some basics",uri:"/peertube-plugin-livechat/sv/documentation/user/streamers/basics/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Peertube livechat > Documentation > User documentation > For streamers",content:` Info This feature comes with the livechat plugin version 8.0.0, and can be disabled by your instance’s admins.

This can be really usefull to:
avoid message flooding avoid unreadable chat if there are many viewers talking You can set a number of seconds that users will have to wait after sending a message, before sending another.
This limitation does not apply to moderators.
Slow mode option On the channel configuration page, you can set the slow mode option:
This value will apply as a default value for all your channel’s chatrooms.
Setting the value to 0 will disable the feature.
Setting the value to a positive integer will set the period during which users will not be able to post additional messages.

This value will apply as a default value for all your channel’s chatrooms.
Setting the value to 0 will disable the feature.

To modify the value for an already existing room, just open the room “configuration” menu (on top of the chat window), and change the moderation delay value in the configuration form.
Warning Currently, this feature has one known bug: users that join the chat will get all messages, even messages that are still pending for other participants. However, messages sent after they joined will be delayed correctly.
Tip You can combine a short moderation delay (1 second for example) with the moderation bot to delete messages containing swear words before any non-moderator user will see them.
