### Importante Notes

This version requires Peertube 5.2.0 or superior.
It also requires NodeJS 16 or superior (same as Peertube 5.2.0.).

If you use the "system Prosody", you should update to Prosody 0.12.4, and Lua 5.4.

## 11.0.0

### Importante Notes

With the new [mod_firewall](https://livingston.frama.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/documentation/admin/mod_firewall/) feature, Peertube admins can write firewall rules for the Prosody server. These rules could be used to run arbitrary code on the server. If you are a hosting provider, and you don't want to allow Peertube admins to write such rules, you can disable the online editing by creating a `disable_mod_firewall_editing` file in the plugin directory. Check the documentation for more information. This is opt-out, as Peertube admins can already run arbitrary code just by installing any plugin.

The concord theme was removed from ConverseJS. If you had it set in the plugin settings, it will fallback to the Peertube theme.

More info in the [tasks documentation](https://livingston.frama.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/documentation/user/streamers/tasks/).
* #385: new way of managing chat access rights. Now streamers are owner of their chat rooms. Peertube admins/moderators are not by default, so that their identities are not leaking. But they have a button to promote as chat room owner, if they need to take action. Please note that there is a migration script that will remove all Peertube admins/moderators affiliations (unless they are video/channel's owner). They can get this access back using the button.
* #385: the slow mode duration on the channel option page is now a default value for new rooms. Streamers can change the value room per room in the room's configuration.

## 9.0.3

### Minor changes and fixes

* Fix missing titles on some buttons when the chat is open.
* Fix select styling in ConverseJS.

## 9.0.2

* Translation updates: french, croatian, deutsch, japanese.
* New lang: turkish (available with Peertube >= 6.1.0).
* Minor JS fix.

## 9.0.1

### Minor changes and fixes

* Fix #370: "open with a remote Peertube" broken when chat is embedded in an iframe.
* Fix UI on little screens (form for anonymous users was too high).

## 9.0.0

**Breaking changes**:

* If you were adding custom CSS to livechat iframe, it could be broken, as the livechat is no more included in an iframe. Your custom styles are now added on a `div` element.
* If you enabled [XMPP Clients connections](https://livingston.frama.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/documentation/admin/advanced/xmpp_clients/), you must add a new DNS entry for `external.your_instance.example.com`. Check the documentation.

### New features

* For anonymous users: new "log in using an external account" dialog, with following options:
  * remote Peertube account,
  * #128, #363 (**Experimental Feature**): possibility to configure an OpenID Connect provider on the instance level.
  * #128, #367: adding some standard OpenID Connect providers (Google, Facebook).
* #143: User colors: implementing [XEP-0392](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0392.html) to have random colors on users nicknames
* #330: Chat does no more use an iframe to display the chat besides the videos.
* #330: Fullscreen chat: now uses a custom page (in other words: when opening the chat in a new tab, you will have the Peertube menu).
* #355: ConverseJS dropdown menu available everywhere, inclusing when chat is besides the video.

### Minor changes and fixes

* Some code refactoring.
* New translations: Galician, German, French, Spanish, Crotian.
* Fix slow mode: focus was lost when textarea got disabled, so it could trigger some Peertube events if the user type some text.
* #48: Proper 404 and 403 pages when trying to open non-existant chatroom.

## 8.4.0

* Fix #87: updating chat room title when video/channel title is changed.
* Updating xmppjs-chat-box version.
* Translation updates: deutsch, japanese, russian.
* Updating slow mode duration on existing rooms when changing channel options (related to #332).
  * This settings is no more a default duration, but the actual duration (updating labels and documentation).
* Settings: orange warning for the "Enable connection to room using external XMPP accounts" settings.

## 8.3.2

* Temporary security fix for #332: rollback of v8.3.1:
  * Setting video owner as room owner as side effects. Like leaking the instance moderator/admin list. And maybe others.
  * So we rollback this feature, waiting for a better way to allow room admins/moderators to change room settings.
  * As a consequence, users that are not Peertube moderator/administrator can't change the slow mode configuration without deleting/recreating the room. This will be fixed in a later plugin version.
* Fix mod_muc_slow_mode: add min value for slow_mode_duration field.
* Debug Mode: new option to promote some JIDs as admins on the MUC component.
* Fix #322: "Sepia is no longer an owner of this groupchat" message when joining the chat.
  * This was related to the fact that the bot was owner because of the "admins" Prosody config key, and not registered in the room.
  * To fix it, i added the bot as owner when creating rooms.
  * This means that the fix only work for newly created rooms.
  * There might still be an issue in ConverseJS or Prosody, don't know exactly where.

## 8.3.1

* Fix: video owner must be room owner, not only admin. Otherwise they can't edit room parameters (including slow mode settings).

## 8.3.0

### New features

* Slow mode (#192):
  * new option in room configuration to set the slow mode duration (new prosody module mod_muc_slow_mode).
  * default duration is configurable in channel's chat rooms options.
  * backend rejects messages when the slow mode is not respected.
  * front-end: display an infobox when slow mode is active.
  * front-end: disable the message field during the slow mode duration.

### Minor changes and fixes

* Fix ConverseJS build: translations were missing, and only english was available.
* Replaced a sync file operation by an async one, to avoid blocking the server.
* Fix ConverseJS bug: room information not correctly refreshed when modifications are made by other users.
* Translation update: German, French.

## 8.2.1

## 8.1.0

### Minor changes and fixes

This version comes with a lot of UX/UI and performances improvements:

* Anonymous chat user: remember the chosen nickname in localStorage, to avoid entering it again too often. Nickname will expire after 12 hours.
* Fix: if an anonymous chat user enter spaces in the nickname choice, it allowed them to keep the random nickname.
* Authenticated users: if current user nickname is already used in the room, automatically add a suffix.
* UX: add a label ('Choose a nickname to enter') for the anonymous nickname prompt. Fix #287.
* Translation updates: Arabic, German, French, Swedish, Spanish.
* New Swedish translations.
* UI/UX improvements:
  * hide nickname changes when previous nickname was like "Anonymous 12345". Helps to improve performances when massive anonymous users are joining (#138), and prevent displaying unnecessary messages (#111).
  * display anonymous users at the end of the participants list (Fix #136)
  * don't group "followup" messages, and always display avatar/nickname/datetime besides messages, even when it is the same user as previous one (#305)
  * Adding "users" icon in the menu toggle button
  * Destroy room: remove the challenge, and the new JID
* Using patched ConverseJS for performance improvement (related to #96):
  * debounce MUC sidebar rendering in ConverseJS (Fix #138)
  * force history pruning, even if messages keep coming (Fix #140)
  * don't load all vCards when right menu is not visible (Fix #106)
  * Changing the default avatar to minimize blinking effect when a user sends his first message
  * Custom settings livechat_load_all_vcards for the readonly mode
  * Removing unecessary plugins: headless/pubsub, minimize, notifications, profile, omemo, push, roomlist, dragresize (generated JS is about 10% lighter)
* Prosody: disabling message carbons for anonymous users (See #295)
* Peertube users avatars optimization (Fix #303):
  * avoid multiple parallel request to load same avatar from Peertube
  * send "item-not-found" stanza when no avatar, instead of a vCard without avatar

## 8.0.4

### Minor changes and fixes

* Updated spanish translations.
* ConverseJS: using `prune_messages_above` to purge old messages, keeping only last 100 (Fix #140).
* NPM packages security fixes.

## 8.0.3

### Minor changes and fixes

* Peertube v6.0.0 compatibility:
  * xmpp avatars: using account.avatars if account.avatar is not available (Fix #275).
  * chatrooms screen: using channel.avatars if channel.avatar is not available (Fix #276).
* Translation updates: German, Dutch, Japanese, Basque.
* Security fix for npm packages (only used for building, does not impact the produced package).

## 8.0.2

### Minor changes and fixes

* On some Ubuntu server, the self-signed certificates generation fails:
  * See [issue #268](https://github.com/JohnXLivingston/peertube-plugin-livechat/issues/268)
  * This prevents the bot to connect to the server
  * As a fallback, we directly call openssl to generate the certificates

## 8.0.1

### Minor changes and fixes

* Channel configuration:
  * Fix dark mode for buttons.
  * Fix buttons margin.
  * Don't validate hidden fields.
  * Fix disabling bot.
* Help button on top of the "channels" page.
* Renaming "pre-recorded message" to "timers".

## 8.0.0

### New features

* Moderation bot (experimental new feature):
  * New "chatrooms" menu, accessible to all users
  * In this menu, user's channels are listed
  * For each channel, there is a new screen where you can setup new channel's chatroom options
  * These options applies to all channel's video that have livechat activated
  * For now, there are options related to the new Moderation Bot:
    * you can make it auto-delete messages containing "forbidden words",
    * make it send pre-recorded messages every X minutes,
    * respond message to custom commands.
    * many other features will be available in future releases!
* New settings: "Ban anonymous user's IP when user is banned from a chatroom":
  * if enabled, every time a streamer bans an anonymous user, it will ban its IP on the chat server,
  * banned IPs are logged on disk, so server's admin can use them to feed fail2ban (for example),
  * option disabled by default, because could be used to create trapped-rooms on public servers

### Minor changes and fixes

* ConverseJS v10.1.6 (instead of v10.0.0).
* New polish translation (Thanks [ewm](https://weblate.framasoft.org/user/ewm/)).
* Links to documentation are now using the front-end language to point to the translated documentation page (except for some links generated from the backend, in the diagnostic tool for example).
* Some code refactoring.
* You can now configure on which network interfaces Prosody will listen for external components.
* Prosody: removing the BOSH module from the global scope (must only be present on relevant virtualhosts).

## 7.2.2

### Minor changes and fixes

* Bypassing Nginx for API call originated from Prosody (if Peertube >=5.1). Can also fix some Docker setup, which needed to set the prosody-peertube-uri settings.
* Translation updates.
* The Prosody AppImage is no more built in this plugin, but downloaded from [prosody-appimage](https://github.com/JohnXLivingston/prosody-appimage).

## 7.2.1

### Minor changes and fixes

* Fix link to documentation in french.
* Adding a help button in the share chat modal.

## 7.2.0

### New Features

* Adding a help button on top of the chat, that links to the online documentation on frama.io.
* Implementing the [FEP-1970](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/1970/fep-1970.md) draft for ActivityPub chat declaration.

* Adding links to the documentation in the diagnostic tool.

## 7.1.0

### Minor changes and fixes

* Translations are now made using [Weblate](https://weblate.framasoft.org/projects/peertube-livechat/peertube-plugin-livechat/). This requires some technical changes, but there is no functional differences.
* Translation updates.

## 7.0.2

* Fix: Letsencrypt certificate import procedure was not working on server that had never installed Prosody. Adding `prosody_user` in the Prosody configuration file to fix this. Updating the procedure: the `chown` is no more needed in `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/prosody.sh`.

## 7.0.1

* Fix: trying to connect to a remote instance using direct s2s won't work if local instance has not the feature enabled, and if the remote instance does not know the local one. So using Websocket S2S in such case (that embed a discovery mecanism).

## 7.0.0

### Importante Notes

If you enabled external XMPP connection with plugin v6.3.0,
and are not using the standard 5269 port, you must add and additional DNS SRV record.
Check the [documentation](https://johnxlivingston.github.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/documentation/admin/advanced/xmpp_clients/).

If you are using arm64 CPU, you no longer need to manually install Prosody on your server.
You can now uncheck the "use system prosody" option, and uninstall Prosody if you don't use it for anything else.

If you are using ["system Prosody"](https://johnxlivingston.github.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/documentation/admin/settings/#use-system-prosody),
please not that this version will only properly work with Prosody >= 0.12.0.
If you are using an older version, Chat Federation could be broken, and it could have some unexpected behaviour.

### New Features

* Chat Federation:
  * You can now connect to a remote chat with your local account.
  * This remote connection is done using a custom implementation of [XEP-0468: WebSocket S2S](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0468.html), using some specific discovering method (so that it will work without any DNS configuration).
  * If the remote instance has configured external XMPP connections, it will use legacy S2S connection instead of Websocket S2S.
  * The discovering methods are experimental and temporary. They will be replaced by something that uses XMPP standards in a later release.
* ARM64 CPU support! The Prosody builtin AppImage is now compatible with ARM64 CPU.

### Minor changes and fixes

* Possibility to debug Prosody in development environments.
* Using process.spawn instead of process.exec to launch Prosody (safer, and more optimal).
* Prosody AppImage: fix path mapping: we only map necessary /etc/ subdir, so that the AppImage can access to /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/hosts, ...
* Prosody AppImage: hidden debug mode to disable lua-unbound, that seems broken in some docker dev environments.
* Debug Mode: can change some parameters.
* Fix use case where self-signed certificates are missing.
* Prosody recommended version is now 0.12.x.

## 6.3.0

### New Features

* Chat Federation !
  * This version of the plugin is the first that enables chat between Peertube instances.
  * This feature is a first beta release. It will be improved.
  * This feature requires Peertube >= 5.1.0. The plugin is still compatible with previous version, but the chat federation won't work.
  * By default, chat of video hosted on your instance will be shown on remote instances. You can disable this in the plugin settings.
  * By default, user from your instance will see remote chats. You can disable remote chats in the plugin settings.
  * When a user from your instance joins a remote chat, it will use your local ConverseJS, and will connect directly on the remote instance, as an anonymous XMPP user. If the user is logged-in on your instance, it will use his nickname by default (if available).
* XMPP clients: you can now allow connection to rooms using external XMPP accounts and XMPP clients. Please note that this feature might require some server configuration to be available. Please refer to the [documentation](https://johnxlivingston.github.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/documentation/admin/advanced/xmpp_clients/) for more informations.

### Minor changes and fixes

* Diagnostic tool: add the result of `prosodyctl check` in the debug section.
* New debug mode
* Fix room topic: due to a [bug in mod_muc_http_defaults](https://hg.prosody.im/prosody-modules/rev/6d99ddd99694), room topics were badly configured. The plugin will fix them at startup, and stops trying to set the subject.
* Fix Peertube crash when someone attemps to connect to Websocket endpoint during plugin initialization.

## 6.2.3

### Minor changes and fixes

* Fix italian translation.

## 6.2.2

### Minor changes and fixes

* Fix italian translation.

## 6.2.1

### Minor changes and fixes

* Italian settings page translation (thanks [lost-geographer](https://github.com/lost-geographer)).
* Various translation fixes in french and english (thanks [lost-geographer](https://github.com/lost-geographer)).
* Update npm dependencies with security fixes.

## 6.2.0

### New Features

* Settings page translations:
  * english,
  * french,
  * german (thanks [Gamemap](https://github.com/Gamemap))

### Minor changes and fixes

* Updating a link to the documentation in the settings page.
* Moving `public/images` dir to `assets/images`, because it conflicts with gitlab CI/CD for documentation. Moving `assets/styles.css` to `assets/styles/styles.css`.

## 6.1.0

### Important Notes

If you haven't upgraded to v6.0.0 yet, please read v6.0.0 changelog first.

### New Features

* Share chat link popup: add an option to generate an iframe. #110 #92

### Changes

* Minimum Peertube version is now v4.2.0.
* ConverseJS: Don't send state notifications. #134
* ConverseJS: Don't show join/leave messages. #134
* ConverseJS: remove browser notifications, and browser tab message count.
* ConverseJS: in readonly mode, don't show any info messages (except when disconnected).

### Minor changes and fixes

* Update @types/peertube to v4.2.2 (requiring Peertube v4.2.0).
* Using ESBuild for front-end packing, instead of webpack. Note: for now webpack is still used for ConverseJS.
* Updating NPM dependencies.

## 6.0.0

### Breaking changes

Following modes are removed:

* Connect to an existing XMPP server with ConverseJS
* Use an external web chat tool

The only remaining mode is the recommanded one: «Prosody server controlled by Peertube».

These modes were here for historical reasons (backward compatibility, etc.).
But they became difficult to maintain, and impossible to document (adding a lot of confusion).

Moreover, it seems that they weren't really used.

**Note:** If you were using one of the 2 removed modes, or if you disabled the plugin in the settings,
the server will try to use the new mode after updating the plugin.
If you don't want the chat server to be active, just uninstall the plugin
(settings won't be lost, you just have to download it again).

### Important Notes

This version of the plugin comes with a builtin Prosody AppImage.

If you were using this plugin before this version, and if you had installed Prosody manually,
you can safely uninstall Prosody.

If you were using the custom Peertube docker image that is embedding Prosody, you can switch back to the official
Peertube image.

#### Known issues

The Prosody AppImage will only work on x86_64 CPU.
It is not compatible with arm64 and other CPU architectures.

For now, I did not manage to make it work for other CPU architectures.
If you want te be notified when it will be possible, you can subscribe and comment this
[issue](https://github.com/JohnXLivingston/peertube-plugin-livechat/issues/124).

In the meantime, you can use the plugin by [manually installing Prosody](documentation/installation.md) on your server
(as for version priori to v6.0.0).

### New Features

* Removed deprecated modes, only keeping «Prosody server controlled by Peertube».
* BOSH proxy optimization + enabling websocket.
* Builtin Prosody 0.12.1 AppImage. No more manual installation required.

### Changes

* ConverseJS v10.0.0 (instead of v9.0.0).
* Prosody server: enabling mod_disco.
* Settings page re-ordered.
* Cleaning deprecated documentation.
* Removing the code of the Docker image, as it is no more needed.
* Japanese translations (thanks [fusengum](https://github.com/fusengum)).

### Minor changes and fixes

* Fix «autocolor» mecanism when no color provided (raised an error).
* Fix #73: deleted message are shown when loading history.
* Implements #37: diagnostic tools includes last lines from prosody error log files.

## 5.7.1

* Adding an easy way to customize background transparency in OBS and co.

## 5.7.0

### New features

* You can disable the chat for anonymous users (users that are not connected to your Peertube instance).
  * Note: this is a first version of this feature, released to quickly help some Peertube admins that are facing spam attacks.
  * The chat will not be visible at all for anonymous users.
  * In a future release, the chat will be replaced by a message saying «please log in to [...]».
  * If you are not using the «Prosody controlled by Peertube» mode, this settings is not a real security feature. An attacker could easily find the chat uri and join it.

## 5.6.0

### Important notes

Following modes are deprecated and will be soon removed (in version 6.0.0, scheduled for may or june 2022):

* Connect to an existing XMPP server with ConverseJS
* Use an external web chat tool

The only remaining mode will be the recommanded one: «Prosody server controlled by Peertube».

If you need one of the 2 deprecated mode, please open an issue ASAP to explain your use case.

These modes were here for historical reasons (backward compatibility, etc.).
But now there are hard to maintain, and impossible to document (adding a lot of confusion).
Moreover, they don't seem to be used much.

### Changes

* Adding a deprecation warning in the settings page when using one of the 2 deprecated mode.
* Adding German translations (thanks [Gamemap](https://github.com/Gamemap)).
* Updating dependencies.

## 5.5.0

### Features
