It is not compatible with arm64 and other CPU architectures.\nFor now, I did not manage to make it work for other CPU architectures. If you want te be notified when it will be possible, you can subscribe and comment this issue.\nTo use the plugin, you will have to manually install Prosody on your server (see below).\nOnce it is done, you have to check Use system Prosody in the plugin settings.\nOn non-docker Peertube installation For standard installation, you just have to install the official prosody package for your linux distribution.\nFor example, on Debian/Ubuntu:\nsudo apt install prosody You can then disable the service that starts automatically when you install Prosody (the plugin will launch a Prosody process, there is no need for the service to run). For example, on Debian/Ubuntu (and other Systemd based linux distributions):\nsudo systemctl disable prosody \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo systemctl stop prosody Warning: do not disable Prosody if it is used for another service on your server, like for example Jitsi.\nDocker You will have to generate a Peertube image that includes Prosody in the same container that Peertube. I know this is not the standard way to do this with Docker, but keep in mind it is a temporary workaround.\nTo generate and use such an image, please refer to the Docker documentation. The Docker file to generate the image should be:\nFROM chocobozzz/peertube:production-bullseye RUN apt -y update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt install -y prosody \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt -y clean Yunohost You have to disable metronome (the XMPP server provided by Yunohost), and install prosody.\nThis is already done by the Yunohost Peertube application, as it was required for the plugin before the v6.0.0. But it may be removed in a near feature (to avoid drawbacks of this method). I have to discuss with Yunohost team, to decide how we can do to minimize drawbacks, and maximize compatibility.\n"},{"uri":"https://johnxlivingston.github.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/documentation/user/moderation/","title":"Moderation","tags":[],"description":"Plugin peertube-plugin-livechat moderation","content":"You can access room settings and moderation tools by opening the chat in a new window, and using the dropdown menu at the top right.\nYou can list all existing chatrooms: in the plugin settings screen, there is a button «List rooms».\nYou can delete old rooms: join the room, and use the menu on the top to destroy the room.\nNotes All instance moderators and admins will be owner of created chat rooms. If the video is local (not from a remote Peertube), the video owner will be admin in the chat room.\nYou can use ConverseJS moderation commands to moderate the room.

Then use this link as a «web browser source» in OBS.\nYou can use the «Transparent background» to have a transparent background in OBS. If you want to customize the background transparency, you can add this CSS in your OBS browser source\u0026rsquo;s settings:\n:root { --livechat-transparent: rgba(255 255 255 / 90%) !important; } Note: you can customize colors. This is undocumented yet, but you can try this: in the modal, check «use curent theme colors», then you can try to manually change color values in the URL. You must use valid CSS color values, and they must be properly URL encoded.\nMixing multiple chats in your live stream You can use the social_stream browser extension to mix multiple chat source (from Peertube, Twitch, Youtube, Facebook, \u0026hellip;) and include their contents in your live stream. The compatibility with this plugin was added in recent versions.\n"},{"uri":"https://johnxlivingston.github.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/documentation/admin/settings/","title":"Settings","tags":[],"description":"Plugin Peertube Livechat settings","content":"This section describes the plugin settings page.\nList existing rooms When pressing the «List rooms» button, all existing chatrooms will be listed. You can then find them and moderated them.\nChat behaviour Room type You can choose here to have separate rooms for each video, or to group them by channel.\nAutomatically open the chat If checked, the chat will be loaded as soon as you are on the video page.\nShow the «open in new window» button If your web chat tool can be opened in a full window, you can add a button to do so.\nIf you are using an external web chat tool (see the chat mode «Use an external web chat tool»), maybe it will not work in fullscreen (for example if it needs to access the parent window to get video informations). You can disable this button by unchecking this settings.\nShow the «share chat link» button This feature enables a «share chat link» modal. With this modal, you can generate URLs to join the chat. The chat can be customized (readonly mode, use the current theme, \u0026hellip;).\nYou can for example generate a readonly URL and use it in OBS to integrate the chat in your live stream!\nThis settings allows you to choose who can access this modal.\nChats are only available for local videos Peertube is a federated service. Plugins are only available on the server you are browsing. So, if you are watching a remote video, only you will have the webchat, not users from remote instances. Therefore, this options is checked by default and prevent displaying a webchat for remote videos.\nUsers can activate the chat for their lives If checked, all live videos will have a checkbox in their properties for enabling the web chat. The video owner will be able to activate web chats.\nActivate chat for all lives The chat will be available for all Peertube live videos on your instance.\nActivate chat for all non-lives The chat will be available for all Peertube video that are not live.\nActivate chat for these videos You can choose some UUIDs for which the chat will be available. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want te enable the feature for all videos, you can use this field to list videos UUIDs. You can add comments: everything rights to the # character will be stripped off, as for empty lines.\nHide the chat for anonymous users If checked, anonymous Peertube users won\u0026rsquo;t see the chat.\nNote: for now this feature simply hide the chat. In a future release, the chat will be replaced by a message saying «please log in to [\u0026hellip;]». See v5.7.0 Release Notes for more information.\nTheming ConverseJS theme You can choose which theme to use for ConverseJS:\nPeertube theme: this is a special theme, made especially for peertube\u0026rsquo;s integration. Default ConverseJS theme: this is the default ConverseJS theme. ConverseJS concord theme: this is a theme provided by ConverseJS. Automatic color detection Try to auto detect colors from user\u0026rsquo;s current theme. When this settings is enabled, the plugin tries to auto-detect colors to apply to the chat theme. If this is not correctly working for some of your Peertube theme, you can disable this option.\nWebchat iframe style attribute You can add some custom styles that will be added to the iframe. For example a custom width:\nwidth:400px;\nChat server advanced settings Use system Prosody The plugin comes with an AppImage that is used to run the Prosody XMPP server. If this AppImage is not working, you can fallback to the Prosody that is packaged for your server. Just install the prosody package.\nThis settings should only be used if the plugin is broken, and waiting for a patch.\nDisable Websocket With Peertube \u0026gt;= 5.0.0, this plugin try to use Websocket connection for chatting. If the user\u0026rsquo;s browser or connection is not compatible, the browser will automatically fallback on the BOSH protocol.\nBut in rare case, this can fail. For example if you have a reverse proxy in front of Peertube that does not allow Websocket connection for plugins. In this case, you can check this settings to disable Websocket connections.\nProsody port This is the port that the Prosody server will use. By default it is set to 52800. If you want to use another port, just change the value here.\nPeertube URL for API calls In some rare cases, Prosody can\u0026rsquo;t call Peertube\u0026rsquo;s API from its public URI. If you have such issues (see the diagnostic tool result), you can try to set the value of this settings to http://localhost:9000 or http://127.0.0.1:9000 (supposing your Peertube is listening on port 9000. Check that in your Peertube config/production.yaml file).\nLog rooms content by default If checked, room content will be archived on the server by default. This means that users who join the chan will see messages sent before they have joined.\nPlease note that it is always possible to enable/disable the content logging for a specific room, by editing its properties.\nRoom logs expiration You can set here the expiration delay for room logs. See the online help for accepted values.\nEnable client to server connections This setting enable XMPP clients to connect to the builtin Prosody server. For now, this option only allows connections from localhost clients.\nAs example, this option can allow an instance of Matterbridge (once it could use anonymous login) on the same machine to bridge your chat with another services like a Matrix room.\nProsody client to server port The port that will be used by the c2s module of the builtin Prosody server. XMPP clients shall use this port to connect. Change it if this port is already in use on your server.\nEnable external XMPP components This settings enable XMPP external components to connect to the server. For now, this option only allows connections from localhost components.\nThis feature could be used to connect bridges or bots.\nMore informations on Prosody external components here.\n"},{"uri":"https://johnxlivingston.github.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/documentation/admin/advanced/","title":"Advanced usage","tags":[],"description":"Some advanced features","content":" Using Matterbridge Using Matterbridge to bridge with other chats\n"},{"uri":"https://johnxlivingston.github.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/contributing/translate/","title":"Translate","tags":[],"description":"Translate the plugin","content":"You can help us to translate this PeerTube plugin by creating or modifying translation files in the languages folder.\nFor now, translation is done in the git repository. Later in 2023, online translation tools will be set (probably Weblate). This will make the translation process easier.\nPlease work on the develop branch, and do your commits and pull request on this branch.\nStandard application strings If the language you are interesting in does not exist yet, create a file code.json in the languages folder, where code is the language code. The language code must be the same as the Peertube\u0026rsquo;s langage code (see Peertube documentation). Then add the language file in the package.json file, under the key translations.\nTranslation strings are set in the language file as follow:\nfiles are in JSON format the JSON key is the english string (see existing keys in the french translation file). the JSON value is the translating string NB: there is no english translation file (this is how translation works for peertube\u0026rsquo;s plugins) Settings translations In the plugin settings page, there are more complex strings. They can be HTML code, with newlines, HTML tags, \u0026hellip; This is not suitable for the JSON format.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why the process is a little bit different for settings strings.\nSettings strings are defined in YAML files. They don\u0026rsquo;t use the english text as key, but a codified key, like list_rooms_label.\nOn the contrary of the standards application strings, there is also a configuration file for the english language.\nThese files are in the folder languages/settings. If the file for the language that you are interested in does not exist, just create a new file named code.yml, where code is the language code (see above).\nThen, you can copy YAML keys from the reference file languages/settings/en.yml, and translate strings.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t want to translate a string, you can ignore it, or use null or ~ as value.\nThere might be some «very technical» strings. If you are not 100% sure of the meaning, or of your translation, you better not translate it, so it will display in english.\n"},{"uri":"https://johnxlivingston.github.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/documentation/admin/","title":"Admin documentation","tags":[],"description":"Plugin Peertube Livechat administration","content":" Settings Plugin Peertube Livechat settings\nAdvanced usage Some advanced features\nUsing Matterbridge Using Matterbridge to bridge with other chats\n"},{"uri":"https://johnxlivingston.github.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/contributing/feedback/","title":"Give your feedback","tags":[],"description":"Give your feedback","content":"You don\u0026rsquo;t need to know how to code to start contributing to this plugin!
