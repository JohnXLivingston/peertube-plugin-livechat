**This folder is deprecated**

We only keep files in this folder to avoid dead links
(links to these files were shared on many websites or social media posts).

The source code for the new documentation is in `support/documentation`, and are used to build these websites:

* [Plugin Livechat Documentation on Github](https://johnxlivingston.github.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/).
* [Plugin Livechat Documentation on Framagit](https://livingston.frama.io/peertube-plugin-livechat/).
